Dear Mrs Smith ,
I was sad to read about Richard not being at his best .
I hope that he will recover soon and that he will make it to our conference .
As far as organisation is concerned , adequate number of double rooms with shower or bath have been booked for your group at the Palace hotel located across the main street from the train station .
To come to our college , you can either watch downhill to the lake front ( about 10 min ) or take the new cable car from the train station .
The college is just stairs away from the bottom end .
The end - to - conference party will take place on a boat cruise on the lake .
It will start with a speech by the Director of the conference , followed by a meal .
The recreative part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students and end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am .
As night may be cold at this time of the year , may I suggest that you take with you a pullover .
Part of that , there is no recommendation as to what to wear .
Depending on the interests of your students , I would suggest that you visit the internet site of the tourist office :
Www.neuchatel.ch .
Yours sincerely
Where are you ? is very often the first question that you will be asked when answering the phone .
Why ?
Because somebody has invented the most popular communication device ever .
The mobile phone .
Once heavy , expensive and not reliable , the new mobile phone fits in almost any pocket and is given away by the operator to attract new customers .
Due to the mobile phone .
Communication has changed , not improved .
Of course it allows to be reached everywhere ( even in places you would n't want . )
For rescue teams , it is a great help .
But is n't it a handicap outside professional life .
Should n't people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 2 miles away .
It is not rare to see two people walking side by side , both talking on the phone .
Would n't it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of dialing home to ask which salad to buy .
Mobile phone is a marvellous invention but as for cigarettes , we should right on it
CAUTION : use of this device may damage your brain .
Dear Mrs Smith
I am writing to reply your letter you wrote me on 10 June .
Firstly , I would like to tell you , that the group has been booked into Palace Hotel , which locates beside the congress house in the centre .
You can make contact with Mrs Brackenbury using the number 06 8793888 .
Secondly , the best way from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus , which is specially organized by us .
The bus leaves at 8:00 every morning and gets back to the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening .
Off course there 's also a bus number 8 in front of the hotel is also suitable , but it leaves only every half an hour .
The end - to - conference party , which happens in the evening on 20 June , is going to be held on the coast .
Beside the barbecue , there are some well - known student bands from our country are performing music through the whole night .
What 's more is , that there 's a Latin music band came to make the party more colourful .
It plays from 10:00 to 11:00 , while the students can enjoy it with dancing .
The main events of the party will end up at about 12:30 in the night .
As you see , what to wear is just something casual .
Finally , on the last afternoon , we could visit the museums , markets
( we have a very interesting robot - market ) .
Basically it 's a free time for the students to look round here by themselves .
I hope your question re answered appropriately .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
Yours sincerely ,
Computer Life
Now - a - day computer can be found in almost every corner , in offices , in shops .
Or even in cars and machines there were computer chips .
What has computer affected in our lives ?
First of all , the efficiency of the society has been improved .
When shopping , we do n't need to wait the Kasse to take every article 's note by hand .
When booking an airline , we can just simply make a phone to any agency , and get it done in one minute .
Secondly , instead of looking up tons of books to get the information what we need , we can very easily search it from internet or on the local network .
It 's a very often heard , that someone , who has a special illness , gets operations by a foreign institutes , which he find via internet .
Moreover , with computer network , it can be possible that people work from home , making projects , control operations or having conferences .
Lastly the way of communication has been also changed .
Instead of the traditional telecommunication , we can talk , mail or even see each other with the help of computer network .
Of course there are also some aspects in which the computer technology need to be improved .
For example , reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as on paper .
A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security .
Till now , to completely rely on computer is still somehow not safe enough .
In conclusion , computers have become a very essential necessity of our life , and it 's still a young invention , which need to be improved .
Dear Maria
First of all , I am sorry about Richard illness .
Please remember me to him and given him my best wishes .
About your request , I 'm going to give you all the information that I think you must need , however you can call me if you consider it necessary , ( my phone number is 2496 9731 ) .
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel .
Because it is a wellborn hotel it should be easy to find it .
Moreover , it is really well - located so it will allow you to move around the city without any problem .
Even more the conference is going to take place in the Exhibition Centre , which is located only five minutes walking far from the hotel .
We haven't asked for any special clothes so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes , although you can come well - dressed , if you feel better .
After the conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a previous snack time in order to introduce each others .
Finally in my opinion , you should visit the Art Gallery .
It will take you two or three hours but it 's a gorgeous place .
I look forward hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
" Sagrada Familia " a real holly building .
If you are looking for a special building in Barcelona , which you can like whatever your tastes are , you should visit the " Sagrada Familia " .
Among the big number of choices , this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view fro the top of its towers , a charming story and one of the most representative examples of the Catalonia modernist art .
Gaudi conceived this church n 1912 , though it was n't until 1920 they started to build it .
Since the beginning the work was interrupted in different periods and started again .
After Saudi death it was critical stop which was fortunately solved three years later .
Nowadays , the hard work is being done in order to finish as soon as possible .
The visitor can wonder around all the building or follow a guided visit .
There is an exhibition room where maps and projects can be consulted .
And , unless you suffer from your heart , you should climb the 350 steps which carry you to the top .
There you can enjoy a terrific view , not only will you see almost all the city but also you will discover another perspective of this magnific building .
Dear Mrs Smith
As you know I am in charge to organise the conference in my college .
Do not worry if Richard did not leave you all the information .
I am pleased to help you .
We looked at every hotel in town trying to give you the best offer .
We found two good hotels but we decided at the Palace Hotel .
This has the best price that we could find .
The conference day our school driver is going to pick you up at the hotel and take you to the conference .
The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college so the best way to get there is walking .
You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear very casual .
Finally , the last day I suggest you to go to the mall where you can enjoy shopping and looking around .
Yours sincerely ,
Introduction
The aim of this report is to recommend you to visit the Fuerte de San Diego Museum .
This is a historical building .
I asked some people in town and this was the best place to choose .
History
The Fuerte de Sandiego Musseum was build at the time when the Spanish people was trying to take all the lands from Mexico , one of the most important people who was at front of the Fuerte was Hernon Cortez , the first Spanish in have more lands than anyone at that time .
Place
The Museum is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco .
Is situated at the top of a little mountain in the " old " part of the city .
You are able to get there by car or walking and see everything which was made at that time .
Conclusion
On the whole this is the best building in Acapulco on his history and reputation .
Is the best place to go and easy to get there .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
As the leader of the conference - organisation , I 'm glad if I can help you .
My wish is that nothing goes wrong .
So you have to know more details about our conference .
Your hotel is called Palace Hotel and it is placed in the city centre .
As far as I know this hotel is very comfortable .
There is also a subway - station near Palace Hotel .
Our college is not much far away .
You only have to take the subway - train .
After three stations you have arrived Brooklyn street .
When you come out of the subway you see our college .
The conference starts at 6 o'clock and ends at 8 o'clock .
The students have prepared a music program at the end - to - conference party .
There will also be an international buffet .
So do n't eat too much before you come .
And please do n't worry about clothes .
There is not any rules .
In our city there is a big adventure swimming park .
I think you should visit Water World on your last day .
You will have a lot of funds , I can tell you .
If you need any further information please call me .
My number is : 793354
Yours faithfully ,
The telephone is a very important invention , which has affected our lives .
It is a way for people to communicate although they are in two different places .
People use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life .
In my opinion people need a telephone .
For example a telephone is very important in job - life .
Nowadays there are no companies which do not have a telephone .
Also it is god for people 's safety .
You can call the police if you were in danger or the ambulance if you are injured .
The people use the telephone also in their personal life .
For example when you want to talk to your family or your friends who live far away .
Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone .
They are able to give and receive information very quickly .
This invention has made our lives easier and quicker .
The telephone has made my own life also easy and quick .
It makes something possible you can not do .
Finally I would say that the telephone is very efficient for people .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing to reply to your letter and to give answers to your questions .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , a five star hotel , which offers many facilities .
It is famous for its friendly staff and comfortable rooms .
The students can get there with the No 35 bus .
They must get on the bus from the city centre and got off after five stations at Palace Station .
The hotel is opposite the station .
At the end - to - conference the college , in which the conference will be held , gives a party for all the students .
It will be offered light food , like sandwiches , pommes frites , chips , sweets and different drinks - no alcohol .
There will be life music and the students can dance and enjoy themselves .
It would be better to wear casual clothes , because they are more comfortable and are liked by students .
On the last day , the students can enjoy a sightseeing tour around the city , which can be arranged if the students want to .
The group can also visit the zoo , the opera or stay and relax at the college 's enormous garden and enjoy the settings .

I would get you the information you are requested .
First of all , we have booked the Palace Hotel in your group .
This hotel is quiet and near the conference building .
However , I would suggest going by bus from the hotel to the conference because this is the most convenient form of transport .

I am in a position to choose a good building which students like myself are interested in .
A ) this museum presents more than 200000 original art pictures .
B ) The building has been built in 1999 , therefore , it is a modern architecture .
C ) This building is as high as the Eiffel Tour in Paris .
D ) This building is included : 30 toilets , 500'000 lights , and also 100 people whom can help you if you need any information .
I would suggest this place because it is interesting to discover the eldest civilisation in the world in one of the modern building .
Mrs Smith ,
I received your letter this morning and I would like to thank you for your interest in the conference .
I hope I can answer your questions .
At first , this international student conference has the intension of explain to students how important is the education .
In addition to this , we choose the luxury Palace Hotel which is comfortable enough and in a good location .
The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city , so you can go by train , bus or car .
I suggest you should go by train and go out in the museum Station .
The Conference will happen in the hotel , which is so much easier .
The Conference , not being modest , it is a quite well organized .
It will start at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon .
I suggest you should wear something informal .
Even though we want to make things as more comfortable as possible to our students .
I am very happy that you want to know my area , although I am afraid an afternoon is not enough .
However , if you want , you can call me and I can show you some interesting places .
I will be very glad .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Affecting Our Lives
Cars , boats , motorbikes , airplanes :
Who did never use this once ?
This is a good question .
The humans seems always that they are running and the fastest of this invention is certainly , the airplane .
At first , when Santos Dummont invented the airplane , he probably did n't think how the people could transform his creation .
In this world , where the nations fight to be the better one could n't be different : the airplane became the most important thing in the war .
Unfortunately , it was used to kill a lot of people .
However , the invention of the airplane has brought us some facilities .
How could a person come from Brazil to Australia ?
Maybe by boat , but it could take too long !
The best way is definitely , by air .
After this invention travel around the world is so much easier .
Now , we have to say thanks and congratulate all the creators who invented facility things for us .
So , the airplane is definitely an important invention , because it has changed people 's lives in wars .
Until now , it is being important in the transport of thousands and thousands of people around the world .
Let 's congratulate Santos Edmonton !

Dear Maria Smith ,
I received your letter and I 'm happy to help you .
We booked the Palace Hotel for your group , it 's nice and quiet .
I 'm sure you 'll be fine here .
We chose the Palace Hotel because it 's near our college , too .
So you are going to come at the conference in some minutes .

At the end of this street you can see our college on your left , it 's a green building .
At the end - to - conference party it 'll be something to eat and drink .
In the big room where we 'll have the party , it 'll be some pictures of our college , you 'll see al the generations who passed here .

Here we have a lot of beautiful things to do , but the best you can do in about three hours is visiting the painting museum .
We all are looking forward to seeing your group .
Yours sincerely ,
TELEVISION
What would our world be without television ?
It is n't easy giving an answer to this question .
Television is an important invention , it permits us to better our way of communication .
This animated box can give us a lot of information coming from all around the world .
Television has affected the " all day life , , , too .
We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs , all what we have to do is watch .
And we like that , because it 's easier nothing doing than engaging ourselves to something that makes us do something .
So television can be a positive or a negative invention , it depends on which use we want to do in this box .
Now we should be able to answer at the introducing question .
No , I do n't think so .
Television has become so important for us that we ca n't thinking that it could n't exist .
Dear Mrs Smith
I am writing to answer your letter about the details of international student conference .
Palace Hotel has been booked and you should first walk from the hotel to the Town Hall railway station , which is North City Line , is yellow line on the map .

Before catching our plane , we will be able to enjoy going shopping around the airport for three hours in the afternoon .
Because there are so many unique shops and you should buy good gifts for your parents
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Mr Wolf
I am writing to answer your questions about the information in an interesting building to visit .
I would like to introduce one building in my town .
" Sky Heaven " which is the name of the building , is for fifteen minutes from the centre of my town .
This building has a hundred floor and it takes about five minutes from the grand to the top in the elevator .
There are many facilities which are a museum , an exhibition and many gift shops where we might also enjoy going shopping .
The reason for my recommendation is that Sky Heaven is the highest building in the world .
You should get the top of the building and experience such an amazing view .
Another reason is that there is a good museum , which tells you about the history of my town so easily and clearly .
It was a good experience for your students .
I hope you will accept my recommendation and am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am glad to help you with the organisation of the international student conference .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube , the building of the conference is then five minutes by foot .
At the end - to - conference there is a party , where we can eat something , dance and speak to each other about the conference .
For the party I suggest you to wear classic clothes ; maybe something black and not red or pink .
I am going to wear black classic trousers and a white jersey - it can be that this information gives you some idea too ..
On the last day we are going to have about three hours free time .
What do you think if we will go to visit the Arts Museum ?
Of if we will go to hear a classic concert near the conference building 's ?
I hope that I have been able to give you some help .
And I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Morgan ,
I am writing a report , which will describe you the most important building of my town .
The most important building of Fiasco is the , , Casa Cavalier Pellanda " .
It is an old big house of a rich lord in the middle of the town .
Into this house there is a big museum , where you could know the past of Fiasco .
Under the museum there is a big dark place , where the wine is produced .
Your American students could learn how the , , Meriot ticinese " is produced and why is it so famous in Titian .
I think that these suggestions could interest your student then Biasco , with its , , Casa Cavalier Pellanda " , is the middle points of two tailes - Leventina and Blenio - and the middle points of two similar but also different cultures too .
I hope that these information will bring you to visit Fiasco and its , , house " .
Yours faithfully ,
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown is n't well and hope he 'll get better soon .
I am more than happy to give you the necessary information .
Your group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is only 2 miles away from our college .
The college will arrange a mini - bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45 , so you can arrive to the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15 .
The reason we do n't suggest you to take a walk from your hotel is that you 'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students .
As you already know we are going to have the end - of - conference party where the Head of the college will give a small speech at the begining , then it will a buffet and a disco .
You do n't need to dress up smartly
But please , make sure that your students do n't wear short or trainers .
Regarding to what you could do with your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you to take the students to our History Museum .
It 's not very big but it has got some amazing information about the history of our town and their people .
There is also a gift shop in there , where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends .
I hope I 've answer all your questions but
If you need anymore information , please let me know .
I am looking forward to seeing you all soon .
Best regards ,
To my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented by a car .
Cars took a big part of our lives .
Everywhere you look you can see cars .
More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car , because it saves a lot of time copper to travelling by public transport .
Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport .
You do n't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus , or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs , you can just jump into a car , tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation .
Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill .
Could you imagine if our police , doctors or fire - fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot ?
I do n't think I need to comment on this .
From my personal experience I realised how it 's important to drive a car when I was living in Johannesburg in South Africa .
I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I could n't drive at that time .
Johannesburg is a very dangerous place to live .
I could n't just go for a walk , it was too dangerous .
There is no public transport
And I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time , and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else .
There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself .
Since I passed my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car before .
I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutely love it !
12th June 2001
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing to inform you some information about an international student conference .
First of all , the hotel which the group has been booked into is The Princes Hotel .
It is very near York Railway Station which you can get there easily .
By rail : get off at York station and you can walk from the station turn left and the hotel is on your left hand side .
By bus : most of the buses in York City Centre pass the station , or you can take a taxi .
Secondly , the conference is very important event for all of us , we agree to wear formal dress .
For example , men should wear suits , ties and so on .
In addition , at the end - to - conference party , we also have a country dancing show .
It could be very special because all the dancers are in our group .
Finally , on the last day we have an afternoon free .
It would be grateful
If we could go for a walk around the city of York and visit the historic buildings .
If you could think of any other ideas It would be very kind of you .
I would be grateful if my idea and all the information could help you .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Inventions have affected all our lives !
Nowadays , a lot of things are invented and make our lives are more convenient than those days .
A car is one of the invention which is very useful .
I think the car is very important to me because it 's very convenient for everyday life .
For example , I can travel to many places in the U.K.
Especially , I live in Whitwell - on - the - Hill ( a village near Malton in North Yorkshire ) .
Can you imagine if I had n't got a car how could I go shopping , go to college and so on ?
In fact , there are buses ( number 843 and 845 ) which go pass my village but the bus fares is very expensive for me .
Apart from that it takes long time to go somewhere .
The car has largely affected my own life .
I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than use public transport .
I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music which I brought some assets with me from Thailand .
I took a car driving theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a practice driving test very soon .
I think I have to drive the car myself , so that it will know more about the advantages of using the car .
In conclusion , I think car is very important to me and it has affected my own life .
If I had more money I will buy another car .
I think it has more advantages than disadvantages .
So , we should say many thanks to the people who invented a car !
Dear Mrs Smith

THE HISTORICAL MUSEUM
Welcome to Athens ! !
Without any doubt , a historical place which provides it 's visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of the Greek history during the passing of centuries .
Do n't miss the chance to visit the historical museum , located in the heart of the capital city .
A traditional building which was built at the beginning of the century .
The historical museum is simply a symbol , a proof of what greed have always considered as main principal : their freedom .
There are five different floors , each of them presents a diffrent chronical period of Greek history , starting from the period before the birth of Juisus and concluding with the revolution of 1967 .
The museum provides the visitor with the opportunity to see original pieces of writing , famous paintings having as main subject the revolution of 1821 , and aspects of the greek religion that has always considered to be vital part of Greek history .
There is a small amount of money that visitors should pay for entry .
Inside the museum there is bookshop has a large variety of historical books , maps etc .
If you really want to discover what Greek history means , we strongly recommend you to visit the historical museum ! ! !
Dear Maria Smith ,
Thank you for your letter and I will try to help you .
I will remind you that the international student conference will be the next month on the first of July .
The hotel that we booked was the Palace Hotel which is near the bus station .
When you are in the bus station you will catch the bus number 37 which will go to town center .
From there you will walk until the college because it is easier to get there than to get on another bus .
Anyway the college is the first road on your right to town center .
After the conference some drink and food will be available in the sport - center which is well equipped for disco - party .
Our party has a special subject ' Western ' .
So we suggest to wear western clothes .
On your last day you could go to the sport - museum which is grateful and famous around the world or only go for a walk around Reconvillier - Park .
I hope that I had answered all of your question and that the conference will be grateful .
Yours sincerely .

Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am writing to answer our questions .
Firstly , I already have booked Palace Hotel for the students .
There is a hotel near my college .
It takes five minutes to get my college by walking .
I will copy the map around the college .
Secondly , I will tell you about the end - to - conference party .
It will start with six o'clock .
The party will be held at the dinning room .
People who will attend the party are many professors , semi - professor and faculty .
So I suggest that the students should wear formal clothes .
Finally , I will give you some ideas for an afternoon free time .
The city in which there is my college is traditional in my country .
For example , there are many shrines , temples , and castles .
I suggest that you should visit these places .
You will have a good time .
In addition , there are many other colleges .
You will be able to see many Japanese students .
I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
If you would like to gain more information , you will ask me everytime .
Yours sincerely .
I suggest that you should visit one building .
My town is the capital of Japan .
So there are many higher buildings .
I think it is like New York .
However , I have only one building which I want you to visit .
The name of the building is ' Sunshine 60 ' .
This is the highest building in Tokyo .
I recommend to visit .
I have three reasons for my recommendation .
Firstly , there is the Jacquerie in the building .
In addition , this is the 60th floor , I went there first time I could n't believed it .
Secondly , if you visit there , you will see everywhere in Tokyo .
The scene of Tokyo is not beautiful , but you think that this city is a developing place .
On the other hand you may think what a small city it is ! !
Finally , there are many shops inside the building .
You will have a good time for shopping .
I hope when you visit , you will be favourite place .
You should visit there .

Re : Information on an interesting building to visit
Introduction
Here is my report for American students who want information on an interesting building to visit in Ankara .
I would like to describe ' Anitkabir '
Findings
1 .
This building 's name is ' Anitkabir ' and it is the biggest building in Ankara .
It built in 1953 .
It was placed in the middle of the forest .
There are different kinds of bird and different kinds of trees present .
2 . It has very big museum inside the building and all building made from stone .
3 . This building 's security guards are very special soldiers .
Their aim is to protect the buildings from the enemy because there is also very big army museum available .
4 . It has no charge for entrance and it has a good view for tourists to see Ankara from the hill .
It opens at 8.00 am to 5.00 pm
Recommendations
I recommend that it is the best building in Ankara to visit because it includes all Turkish history and very good sight seeing .
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
I am writing in reply to your letter to the international student conference .
The hotel which we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel .
It is not far from our college , taking 20 minutes by car .
It would be a good idea to take a taxi from the hotel to the college because the total members of your group are 4 and taxi fare would not be expensive .
There was a taxi rank opposite the hotel .
Regarding the end - to - conference party on Thursday , it starts at 7 p.m. in the garden of the college .
You can wear either casual dresses or fancy ones because we have a fancy - dress competition and the raffle is a bottle of French champaign .
On Friday afternoon , it has set to be a free time .
Therefore , you can go shopping in the town centre which is near the college .
Many beautiful and traditional souvenirs can be found there .
The other suggestion is going to the flower market where is very famous for tourists because it covers 2 acres and there are plenty of flowers to buy .
Moreover , it is the biggest flower market in this area .
I look forward to meeting you soon and hope you have a safe journey .
Yours sincerely ,
Invented Light
There are many sources of light in this world such as sunlight , moonlight , candle light .
Some of them are natural whereas the others are not .
Owing to increasing demand for light for more activities , the natural source is not adequate .
There , electric light has invented .
Nowadays , the electric light has been becoming part of our lives , especially during the night .
Whatever we do at night , we need an electric light .
Have you ever imaged how this world would be if there was no electric light ?
It must have been a big impact on industry , agriculture and our lifestyle .
Think about when the electricity in your house got a short circuit .
Do you feel uncomfortable ?
Could you do anything much without light ?
In addition , the electric light is the manuscript of other electric equipment and they have become an important part of our life , too .
I think we should be grateful that we have got the electric light for comforting our lifestyle .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I was very pleased to receive your letter .
It is my pleasure to help you organise an international student conference .
Firstly , for your information , the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is located on the town centre .
Students can take the airport bus to the hotel directly when you arrive .
And the best way to get from there to the conference is to coach , as there are about 35 international students , they are all strangers here .
Therefore it is no good taking a bus .
I will help you to book a coach .
Secondly , the end - of - conference party will be held at college main hall , at 8:00 pm to 11:30 pm on 20th June .
There will be various kinds of food and drink provided .
Moreover , students can dance and enjoy different sorts of music , for instance , rock , jazz , pop , garage and so on .
Furthermore , I suggest you and the students wearing pub - wears to it , as it is suitable for dancing .
Finally , on the last day , I suggest you could go the market in town during the 3-hour gap .
It is a nice place to buy the British style gifts to your family and friends .
You could also enjoy the tea in the cafés nearby .
I would be grateful to give any help if you need .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
Yours sincerely ,

Subject : Interesting building to visit in Hong Kong
Visiting Po Lin Temple
The purpose of this is to give information to the American students , describing Po Lin Temple is worth - visited .
1 . Brief histories of Po Lin Temple :
It was found in 1910 .
It is a traditional type of Chinese temple .
Because of the 2nd World War , it was re - built in 1960 .
A big Buddha was built in 1997 just next to the temple , which is the largest outdoor Buddha in the world .
2 .
Location :
The location of Po Lin Temple is in Lotus Island , which is the second biggest island in Hong Kong .
3 . Opening and Closing time :
Po Lin Temple is opened to public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday , and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday .
4 . transport
You could take the MTR ( HK underground ) straight to Lotus Island or take the ferry to get there .
Then you need to take the bus A110 , A111 or A112 to Po Lin Temple .
It is quite convenient .
All the buses and MTR have air - condition .
5 .
Attractive points :
You could go sightseeing around the Temple and take photos .
Of course , you may get more knowledge in Hong Kong , as the temple have been here for nearly 100 years .
The well known Big Buddha you must n't miss it , or you will be sorry .
The temple also provide free Chinese traditional style meals for visitors .
6 .
Conclusion :
To sum up , I think Po Lin Temple is a nice place to visit , especially for Americans students .
Easy to get there and free ambition .
On the other hand , Hong Kong is known as a highly commercial city , but you could find something different to Po Lin Temple .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
First of all I 'm sorry to hear that Richard Brown is ill .
As you are the leader of a group instead of him , I 'm delighted to give all the information you have asked for .
The Palace Hotel has been booked for the group , and from there to the conference , we have organized with the hotel 's bus service to take the student to the conference .
We will meet at the lobby at 9.00 AM .

There will be a bus taking students who do not need to stay at the party until the end .
The bus will be service at 9.30 pm and 11.30 pm then at the end of the party will be the last one .
Everybody is free to dress for the party but was considered to be appropriate .

Telephone saved my friendship
It 's very hard to decide which invention is the best .
Because all of them are so important in difference way .
As now I 'm being away from home , telephone is very important to me .
Having telephone I can call my mother , my friends which helped me from home sick , not completely
But I think it 's better than other ways .
To hear the voice of the person you love is the feeling that hard to describe , it 's wonderful and so real , you can imagine their face clearly .
I had a problem with my best friend once when we keep in touch through e - mail .
The problem is the language , we used English but we both were not very good at it by the time which made us misunderstand each other .
However , the problem solved by telephone .
We are now still friends .
Thanks to the invention of the telephone .
Dear Mrs Smith
With reference to the information that you had requested , the hotel that had been booked is the Holiday Inn , in New Port and to get to the University of Wales wich is not far from the hotel , you only need to take a divertion where clearly indicate Carleon and once that you are on the main road all you need to do is to follow the country road which take you direct to the place .
Concerning to the Party at the end of the Conference , this will be formal there fore you will need formal clouding as you know there will be Company directors , managers etc .
As for the last day I would suggest you to take a visit to the local museum and the ruin 's Castle .
In the fist you will find a very interesting collection of Roman Vestiges , also you can visit another section which it supposed to be a Roman cite .
Yours Sincerely ,
I always had consider myself is very looks to be born in the Century because all the amazing human inventions .
As an example let 's have a look and we will see of this nation how it has developed .
We just need to think about the first world wold and all the inventions created thanks to the industrial revolution to these days .
However I feel that at the moment there should emerge more groups to control this development because the industrial pollution that it has been created and it seems that its very little what has been done at the moment in relation to our embiroment .
I hope in the future there will be more and more people interested in this important issue .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I read your letter and I 'm ready to help you .
I think that we have to think which hotel is better for the students .
I have an idea and I think that you will agree with me .
I was thinking of the Palace Hotel because it 's very nice and cheap .
It has comfortable bedrooms and place for parties .
You can book this hotel it 's the best and it 's near to conference it 's only 15 minutes to walk .
I think that it will be nice to the end - to - conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the student the time to enjoy themselves and to dance .
The party it would be nice .
The clothes now that they will wear it has to be smart , not how you are going to casino for example but nice casual , not with sports shoes or T - shirts .
On the last day in the afternoon that you have three ours free you can go for coffee or to visit some places .
Those are my ideas for the conference .
I hope that you will like it .
Your sincerely ,
Today our article it will be about the inventions that we need in our life .
I think that all this thing we need in our life because it can give us a lot of things .
First of all we need the telephone in our house because it 's important to make call if you need something of if it something happens to your house and nobody is next to you .
The second one is the lamp , the electricity that is very important in our life .
In the past the people did n't have electricity and if they wanted for example to read or to cook something they used to do in the fire .
It 's important to have electricity because without this you ca n't do anything .
The other one is the television .
You must have TV because you can listen what it happening in the world and
You can watch some places that you did n't go .
You can enjoy you time to watch a film if you have free time .
The boat it 's not so important but you can use it for fishing and to see some places .
The car now is very important in our life you can go wherever you want .
In this year the family they have 3 cars in one family one by one person .
For me the most important thing is the telephone because without this you ca n't do anything , it 's part of my life .
Dear Maria Smith ,
First of all , the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel .
It is a big hotel because there will be a lot of people .
It has a swimming - pool and a nice bar .
The hotel is ten minutes far from the conference and there will be a bus available to go directly over there .
At the end of the conference , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must have nice clothes ; jean 's is not allowed .
Next to the restaurant , there was a disco for people who like dancing .
We can do a lot of things in my area .
We have the possibility to visit the old town , it 's very nice and there is a lot of shops .
We can visit the old castle or the painting museum too .
I find television the most important invention .
I think it 's good for old people because some of them could not go to the cinema anymore .
In one hand it 's because they have not enough money to pay it and in the other hand it 's because they ca n't move very well for example if they are disabled .
With television , old people are less alone because most of old woman have not her husband anymore .
Television is a good way to be informed of the news .
I prefer being informed by television than newspapers , it 's more relaxing .
I think television is a good invention for children when they have free time and while they are watching television , we do n't have to look after them if we have something important to do .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I 'm very glad to be able to help you out with such situations .
First of all , the group has been booked into ' THE PALACE hotel ' .
You wo n't have any problem to find the college because it 's in front of the hotel , and the conference will be there .
As you know , the conference will start at 11:00 and it will finish at 13:00 , but we will have lunch altogether at 13:30 in the college 's hall until 14:30 .
You 'll have to wear a white shirt and blue trousers , if you want you will be able to wear a blue jacket .
When we had finished you 'll be able to enjoy yourself in our cinema or television room , but if you prefer other things , we 've got a swimming pool and a library , it will your own choice .
I hope it is useful to you .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear group leader ,
In order for your request , I 'm going to give you some information about which is the best place to visit in this town , Fuengirola .
Fuelling has a wonderful and beautiful castle which is right on the sea front .
It is placed at the top of the little hill which is part of the beach .
You ca n't lose the chance to see this castle because it is an excellent view and always there are a lot of people there and there are little shops where you can buy souvenirs .
At the same time you are enjoying the castle you can take a break to go to the beach and you can look at the castle from the sea , it is also amazing .
Also , there is a museum of history inside .
As you see , you have to visit the castle , you wo n't feel regret about that .
Your sincerely ,
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing to answer your letter where you asked for information about the conference and other points in relation with .
The hotel where your group has been booked is the Palace Hotel .
It is a very nice hotel in the centre of the city , and that is very near to the college which the conference is into , five minutes walking .
Going walking is quicker than waiting for a taxi or a bus .
When you arrive at the college there will be people indicating the way to the conference room .
At the end of the conference we are doing a party with some cold good and some drinks .
There will be music as well for dancing .
The director of the College has suggested to wear smart clothes on that occasion and I give you the same advice .
About the afternoon before leaving I have some suggestions .
In the area of the hotel there are two interesting places to visit .
One is the Picasso museum and the other is an important gallery where you can enjoy seeing different kinds of paintings .
I hope my information can help you and it has been useful for you .
I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
Yours sincerely ,
There is an invention that I think that has been very important : the computer .
The computer is very useful and It has affect our own lives , in different meanings .
The computer has done easy a lot of work .
For works that you needed , for example three hours you can do them in ten minutes ; the same !
But computers do n't have affected only in a good way because thank you to computers the number the places of work for the persons is minor .
But , definitely they had been a very important invention .
The last relations with computers is internet .
By internet you can communicate with people in different places in the world at the same moment .
And you can take lots of information about a lot of things .
Every thing that you need you can find it on internet .
Nowadays computer are very development and it is increasing .
What will be next ?
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I have received your letter and I am glad I can help you .
You have been booked to stay in the Palace Hotel which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here .
The best way to get here is ; once you have gone out of the hotel , turn right , then follow the signs to the hospital , because it is just by our college .
When you are in the colleges ask for me .
The conference will take one hour , and , at 8 o'clock the party will start , it is a formal party and you should wear formal stuff .
The dress code is : no jeans .
We will prove you with food and drinks .
For your free hours I have quite a few ideas .
There are lots of things to do here .
We have got a museum which is just two minutes from your hotel .
You can also go to a nearby park and eat something in a café .
If you go to the main street you will find a street full of shops and I am sure the students would like that .
I hope this information will be helpful .
If you have any other questions , please , do contact me .
Looking forward to seeing you soon .
Your sincerely ,
THE MOBILE PHONE
The mobile phone has completely changed our lives , it is an instrument which I can not imagine myself living without .
Apart from being in - fashion it is also a very helpful machine .
Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which would n't work ?
What would you have done in that moment without a mobile phone ?
You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you , amazing , is n't it ?
Nowadays , everyone has a mobile phone .
I am fifteen years old and everybody in my year has got a mobile phone .
Five years ago you would n't have even thought about it .
It has been a plus for me .
For example , now my parents allow me to go to more places just because I have my mobile with me , and , sending text messages is an addiction which every teenager is obsessed with .
All over , the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing to inform you that I have received a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college .
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is not very far from my college .
However , due to the congestion and delay near the hotel , the best way to get from there to the conference is by underground , Victoria Street station .
You would arrive at the other station opposite my college in approximately 15 minutes .
At the end - to - conference party , you may either leave the party or stay in the college for more activities .
All different types of clothing could be worn however jean wears and T - shirts would be common on that day .
Instead staying in the hotel for the last three hours , I suggest that you could perhaps visit our town centre .
The popular attractions in our town , including the art gallery , museum , aquarium , market square , could be found near our monument of our town , the Saltisy Bridge .
I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
The Little Woods shopping mall

It can be accessed from the nearby train station .

I would like to give you necessary details , which can help you to organise the conference .

Therefore , I suggest to wear some casual clothes .

The exposition will take place on " Gribaldi museum " , which you can find on the Crariden street N 5 .
You will never regret about my suggestion .
If you need more information let me know .
Best regards ,
Report on the building of the Berkeley Square .
In order to prepare this report I visited the business college and interviewed some students , I asked them only one question " Which building do you find more beautiful and more interesting in our city ? "
The Students , who were questioned said that there are a lot of interesting buildings in our City .
However the majority of people point out one a very old building , which you can find at Berkeley Square .
Most of the students found this building very particular , because it reflects our history , tradition and culture .
If you visit the building , you will get impression , feeling , that you are in past times .
This building attracts a lot of people , - because it has a very particular style with majestic , antique windows .
In addition , I also visited this place - and I was very impressed .
Finally I would recommend you visit Barkley Square area .
In this area you could also find another different buildings , which would you attract .
Report from the group leader
From
12.06.01
Dear Maria ,
I 've received your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you going to organise very soon , here yo have a little help for it .
At first , I 'd like to tell you that the hotel where you going to stay is " The Palace Hotel " , which is situated at the center of the town .
It ca n't are difficult to find , because is very near to the conference .
Also there is a bus provided for the organisation to take all the students at the hotel .
At the end of the conference it will be a party .
I might suggest you to wear a casual dress , because many students feels relaxing after the whole day sitting and listening all the conference .
The party is amazed by a group of musicians , and as I remember from last year it was unforgiven , because all the people where dancing and having a lot of fun .
It is a well - situated town with a lot of museums to visit especially " the History museum " which I visited last year , and I think you can enjoy as well .
It does n't take a lot of time to visit and the entrance is free .
Wishing I 've been very helpful to you .
Yours sincerely ,
TELEPHONE CHANGE OUR LIVES
It 's impossible Mondays to think a life without that invention how quickly affects our life especially in business .
We ca n't imagine a big company without a phone , that can make business more quickly than anything else .
Also , I was asking too many people in the street .
Could you live without telephone ?
The answer is all the same " impossible " .
An old woman told me how important was the phone when her only son was abroad studying computers in the " Chicago University " , she told me that every night was expecting a call from her son , for her was the line of the happiness .
However it was one person which he told me , it was n't happy at all with the phone , because he used to write a lot , especially at Christmas to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phone him losing a very old fashion .
In my opinion this little " box " that everybody has at home can saves your life , especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation .
In conclusion do n't make a very long phone calls and you wo n't have to pay a very expensive bill .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith
Thank you for your letter .
It 's a shame that I wo n't see Richard because of his illness , but I 'm willing to help you as much as I can .
Then I will give you some information which you asked for in your letter .
Firstly , about your accommodation , our college which I belong to offers visitors free accommodation with full of facilities .
( for example bath , car parking , free internet access , etc . )
They also are located in our campus so you can get to the conference to walk .
Secondly , as you know we 'll have a party after the conference , which will be taking place at our student council hall with some meals .
This party is unlikely to be that formal , but I recommend you not to wear jeans and trainers .
At last , if you have free time for couple of ours , you 'd better visit Kamakura City , which is 30 minutes from our campus by train .
That is very traditional Japanese city where so many temples and heritage are there .
I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it and maybe get familiar with our culture .
By the way , if you have any other questions , please send me a letter again .
Oh Baby , I ca n't live without you !
These days , we 've been surrounded by so any different kinds of products which our ancestors invented .
In our daily life , however , we seldom notice how much convention life we 've got , what is more , how much inconvenience our grandparents had got .
How nasty we are !
Let us try to appreciate their importance again .
As for me , the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer .
I have been a full time student in the university at home , and their classes all requires us to have personal computer and use them at any time .
When you take the class on computer programming , you will definetly need one and it holds true for the class on politics , because you have to study statistic on your computer for doing social research and some analysts .
My professor said ' go and get familiar with your computer , otherwise you 'll fail ' .
I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we usually use without any questions .
That 's the nature of human beings .
But , I think it 's not only our fault but the evidence of how much they integrate in our life .
Dear Mrs smith
I received your letter asking some information about conference

Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing in reply to your letter , which I received yesterday .
Below is a piece of information you will need for the next international student conference at Bournemouth College and some recommendations , which might be useful for the students .
First of all , the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel , which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities .
This is a very central hotel located not far away from the conference hall .
You will be able to get there either by bus ( no 150 ) or on foot .
Next you are welcome to attend the party organized by the end of the conference .
It will begin at elevenish p.m. and may last a whole night .
People are going to be disguised there and it would be a good idea to wear extravagant multi - coloured clothes .
Finally I think that you should jump at opportunities to go to the historical Pergam 's Museum before leaving .
Some of the most amazing masterpieces are exposed there .
I wish you in advance a wonderful trip and look forward to meeting you in Bournemouth .
Your sincerely
To : ( group leader )
From :
Subject : Bournemouth National Museum
As requested I visited the Bournemouth National Museum , which is , to my mind , one of the most interesting buildings in the area .
Below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need .
1 . Architecture
The architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice .
Even if the architectural style may seem a bit ' heavy , this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world .
2 . Exposition
Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day , it is such a rewarding and enriching time that people get never tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each section of the museum .
3 . Restaurant
The adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable as well .
The waiters are friendly and always ready to give advice .
In fact it is just what visitors need after their trip through the museum .
To sum up , I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums , because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also a very uncommon architecture and a quiet restaurant to have a rest if you need to .
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
In reply to your letter , I would like to answer your questions and give you more information .
Firstly , the hotel in which the group is going to stay is ' Palace Hotel ' .
Secondly , the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is a local bus .
There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference .
Thirdly , the end - to - conference party would be a small disco , with a variety of drinks and food provided .
Therefore , you could wear something quite casual .
Lastly , on the last day , I would suggest you to visit the Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum , as both of them are very interesting and have the student discount .
I hope this letter should help you with enough information .
Yours sincerely ,
Could modern people live without a light bulb ?
Well , I do n't think so .
Only people who could live without it , must be extremely weird or somebody in a very difficult situation !
We are nearly always surrounded by the ' man - made ' light .
With it , we read , study , walk , and so on .
In the past people relied on the sunlight , moonlight and the light from fire .
These were , however , very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel runs out .
They had to read , study and walking in the dark .
Today , this kind of thing hardly happen !
Well , unless there was n't anything wrong with the power supply .
I remember when I was about 5 , I visited a museum with my family .
While I was in toilet , all the light was turned off !
I screamed and cried since I 'd never experienced being in a complete darkness before .
When the light was turned on again , I realised how important even a single light bulb would be , and I was sure I can never , ever lived without it .

Dear Mrs Smith ,
In reply to your letter , I will try to give you some advice .
Concerning the hotel , the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel .
The conference will take place not far from the hotel so you will see indications to follow .
For the conference , I suggest you to wear a beautiful dress , because there will be important persons of other colleges .
At the end of the conference , all students and leaders will have a drink .
To finish , if you have spare time , you could walk from the center of Poitiers which is very beautiful .
I hope I give you enough details .
I look forward to meeting you at the conference .
Yours faithfully ,
The building called in French " Le Centre Pompidou " is a very surprising monument .
It 's a modern building with an architecture that you ca n't see in other places .
What is impressive in this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
On the Pompidou 's center , there are different expositions on different themes .
In general , there are paintings , videos and sculptures .
This expositions are often very attractive and they change every year .
Another good point , if you go there you will have an extraordinary view of the city .
So if you visit Paris , the Pompidou 's center is a very interesting building to visit , even if in Paris there are many other buildings .
Dear Maria ,
First of all , I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill .
As the conference must go on , I will give you the information you asked for in order to work on with this conference .
According to the hotel , the group has been arranged to stay in a hotel which is very near the place we are going to have the conference .
The hotel is the Palace Hotel .
It'is just only 5 minutes walk from there to the conference and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference .
About the party , we will have a party at the end of the conference at the hotel you will stay .
The party will be in a friendly atmosphere so do n't worry about what to wear .
There will be only our group , so dress whatever you want and enjoy ourselves .
Lastly , what you could possibly do while you will be waiting for three hours , for some people who want to go shopping .
The shopping centre is just right opposite the hotel , however , some people may want to just wait at the hotel , having a cup of coffee .
The cafe at the hotel is available .
I hope that information will be useful .
If you have any questions I am more than happy to help .
I look forward to seeing you at the conference .
Yours sincerely .
Could you live without this ?
Imagine how your life would be if you woke up one morning and found that all the electricity had gone .
How would you manage to get yourself ready to go to work .
How would you know what happens in the whole wide world or even how you would get yourself breakfast without toaster ! !
!
How would you cope with all those ?
Thank god for those who had created the electricity and had applied it into every appliances .
The electricity is a clever invention .
Everything bases on the use of electricity , for instance from a little bulb light to the most complicated computer system which stored priceless information !
Life would n't be easy if we did n't have electricity .
The electricity is very important in keeping our lives go .
No matter where you are , what you do , apparently , you need the electricity .
Let 's think this way , if we did n't have the electricity , there would be no other inventions at all ! !
I , personally , could n't live without the electricity .
It has already affected and play a great role in my life .
I watch the television and using the computer everyday .
Moreover , other facilities in my house , telephone , air - conditioner , fridge , for example , they are all need the electricity .
That'is why it is very important to my life .
Dear Mrs. Smith
My name is ... , I am a local student and i will give you the requested information .
The rooms for your students have been booked at the Palace Hotel near the city - centre .
The hotel is just three bus stops away from our college .

The end - to - conference party starts just one
Our after the end of the conference .
It is located in our sports hall .
There will be live music and a midnight dinners .
So you do n't have to appear very noble dressed , just as you like it ( there is no order

If you have any more questions written me a short letter .
Yours sincerely
The invention of the car is a great point in history .
From there on people getting mobile and had the possibility to travel wherever they wanted .
Of course within the physical barriers .
People now had the chance to move to far away places to spend their pleasure time , to relax , or just to see something different than their home - countryside .
In my life the car has an enormous influence .
I come from a rural area .
The next city is 15 km away and there is no acceptable bus - or rail connection to go there .
It has been quiet hard for me not to have the opportunities for my free time like my friends that lived in or near the city .
I just had no possibility to meet them after school , because I had no vehicle to get there .
I always needed my mom or my Dad to take me where I wanted to go .
Today I have my own car and I use it daily to get to work and to meet my friends at any place and any time .
So in my car I achieved a great freedom .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am applying your letter where you asked for some information about the conference in Peterborough Regional College .

Our director will make a speech afterwards and there will be a party with some snacks , drinks and music .
For the people interested in , there will be also an amusement karaoke .
Everybody should wear formal clothes , at least , a little bit formal .

Alice knows that is was going to be a very special day for her .
She had a dream where somebody told her that that day would be special .
So , she took the bus , like every morning , and she went to school .
But that day is a little bit different : she had her maths exam .
She had never passed a maths exam and she is really nervous .
Half an hour before the exam she went to the cafeteria to take a cup of tea .
She sat down and what a surprise she found a lottery ticket .
Nobody was around her , so she took the ticket .
Drank her cup of tea and she went to the classroom where the exam took place .
She did the exam really well
, she was very surprised , and after the exam she went home .
She spent the rest of the day listening to music while she was thinking about the lottery ticket and waiting for the TV show at 8 o'clock .
At the time , she turned on the TV and while the lottery 's man was shouting the winning numbers , she checked her and what was the surprise that the last 4 numbers were the same ! !
She won £ 500 ! ! !

There is a wide range of facilities including theatres , game centres , Korean restaurants .
In particular , the people seemed to be satisfied with theatres , because the screen is massive .
The Korean restaurants appear to be the most popular with foreigners .

It seemed you could buy everything you want at reasonable prices in the building .
Specifically , Korean souvenir shops were felt to be extremely cheap .
However , you can buy luxurious things as well if you wish .

Inventions have affected all our lives !
What is it what we use every day many hours ?
Sometime 's early in the morning until late in the evening .
Yes it is a TV .
It is well known in almost all families , often with a lot of different channels .
First of all , the TV can tell us news in a short time , what happened all over the world .
Another point in favour of the invention of the TV is , that they telling about interesting reports , for instance about animals or different culture from other countrys .
Furthermore they have a lot of different programme , usually something for everybody .
It could be also relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work .
Finally , the TV is in my opinion very useful for getting important information , you can watch the weather and all of them were present in wonderful colour .
To sum up , in my opinion the TV is a very good and useful inventions .
However , they send a lot of violence which is not good for the children .
I can not imagine to live without television , it is something what we need for our education , for getting news and other helpful information .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
Surely I 'll try to help you as good as I can .
First , I tell you the name of the hotel , it 's the Palace Hotel .
Fortunately , it is not far from our college .
For getting from the hotel to the conference , you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St. James College , where the conference will take place .
About the end - of - conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night , and a special guest I still do n't know will be expected .
I suggest to wear casual clothes , I think there 's no need for school uniforms .
To answer your last question , I would propose you to attend the local zoo , because many baby animals were born in the past few days .
Dear Mrs Smith , I hope the given information is useful for you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
Yours sincerely ,
The telephone
Could you imagine there 's no telephone ringing in the office ?
Or to live your lives without chatting for hours with your best friend ?
Could you ?
I ca n't !
The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell at the end of the 19th century .
It was an invention nobody thought how important and how widespread it would be in future .
Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone , and calls to relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing .
People need the telephone not only for chatting , but also for exchanging information in a very short and direct way with the possibility to answer immediately .
When I was a child , we had no telephone at home , and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village .
Now I have my own flat , and the first piece of furniture I 've bought was the telephone .
I 'll never take it away from my home .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I want to inform you that I had already talked to Richard Brown and he informed me about the conference .
Next week I will be start organising some events at this conference .
The event will organize at the Palace Hotel .
The same hotel that will you stay .
Palace Hotel is opposite the park ` Clifton ' , which is near the college .
We chose that hotel because is it near the college and we do n't need to use a transport .
Because you know where is the college and you need to bring with me some things at the college to hotel I think that is better to come all the group in college and then we can go all together to the ` Palace Hotel ' .
The conference starts at 9:00 o'clock you need to be at the college half an hour before .
Concerning the end - to - conference I 'm thinking about some dancing and singing events .
Tell me your idea .
About the clothes that we need to wear , must be uniform , because is the best conference to London and every year are coming lectures from other colleges .
Finally on the last day we have organised a seeing - crossing around London .
You will have the opportunity visit some museums and zoos parks .
I think it is a nice idea .
If you want more information you can call me my telephone number is 047***.
Please if you have more ideas sent me a letter .
Yours Sincerely ,
Nowadays all the people have a telephone .
Telephone is part of our life .
It is one of the most important investigation all over the world .
Telephone is type of communication .
If you want to talk with your friends , parents , partner or to ask something , you can call them without wondering how can be communicate with them .
Especial if some of your relatives or friends are living in other countries you can communicate with them and everyday and you do n't feel that they are far a way from you .
Today with the development of technology has been improved and the abilities of the telephone .
They are telephones that you have the opportunity to talk with more than one people at the line .
Also you can leave a message if you call and ca n't find someone .
The last type of telephone , is the mobile phone .
You can use it everywhere and at anytime .
Finally telephone except|apart from type of communication , is type and socialisation .
Nowadays who are so busy and we do n't have free time to see our friends , we can call them and talk or chat with them .
Especial the young people are using many hours the telephone and that is trouble for their parents .
Telephone is very important investigation if we can use it correct without use it as type of entertainment as they are doing nowadays many people .
Dear Mrs Smith
I have received your letter , which was that you would like me to inform you .
As you know , a hotel whose name is Palace Hotel has been booked for your group .
The best way to get from there to the conference is to take a taxi .
I am afraid there are no buses to get there .
We will have a great party at the end of the conference .
The party will be formal , therefore you have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress .
As you know , it was not suitable to wear a jean or something .
On your last day you have the afternoon free .
In my area there is a fantastic park , which is the most famous park in the country .
You can find a lot of things to do or to see .
You can visit the zoo or walk around the amazing lake in the park .
I hope you will find all the details , which you would like to have in the letter .
If you need any information , please let me know .
Your Sincerely ,
Power Of Computers .
How much can a computer affected your life ?
I think it effects more than you think .
When I was a child I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I like , but it was nearly impossible to have them .
I felt lack of them .
I first bought a computer as I was at university .
It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
That time I met the magic world of computers .
Linked to the internet is so popular .
Internet is something amazing for me .
Can you think you have every information you need whenever you want ?
Can you think you contact with anyone who is from any country whenever you want ?
I met a lot of people on internet and it really interest me .
I learned a lot about their culture by speaking them on internet .
I was n't able to imagine this before .
In addition this , today companies can do nothing without a computer .
Everything in this world works with computers from now on .
Computers changed my life style , my opinion of the world .
And they effect everyone 's life directly or indirectly .
Dear Mrs M. Smith ,
I am writing in order to reply to your letter and to give you all the information that you requested .
First of all the hotel is the Palace Hotel , 82 Regent Street , so that it is very easy to reach the conference .
In fact you can take the bus number 3 ; as you can see , the bus stop is just in front of the hotel , then you can get off immediately after the church that you pass , on your right hand .
Secondly , we will have the party in the hotel at 8.00 o'clock and a buffet will be served at 8.30 p.m. It would be also possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge .
I would recommend your students to bring their Identity Card to prove their age .
What is more , I would suggest to wear very smart dress and for men it is obliged the tie .
Finally , if I were you I would go shopping to the City Centre to spend your last hours .
However , if you re interested in archeology you should visit the History Museum in Garden Square .
I hope you will find my letter of interest and I look forward to seeing you .
Yours Sincerely ,
Have you ever thought to live without your car ?
How can you manage your daily life without it ?
I the last forty years people seem to be completely addicted by using their own cars .
It is said that the majority of the citizens has got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted .
On the other hand , this kind of facility has made our lives more comfortable and easy .
In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or on our family and carrying luggage and shopping bags .
Cars are able to cover not only short distances but also can be used for long journeys .
For example , in the past it would have been extremely exhausting travelling riding a horse
But nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from .
However , I have to say that it has made people are lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic .
On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allow us travelling quickly .
That 's why I could n't image my life without it .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
Thank you for your letter which I received last week .
If student is ill , we will return the money but you should tell us until one week before we start .
And you are staying the Palace Hotel , which is located in town centres .
You can take buses or our school buses .
It costs forties pence .
If you take public buses , it costs more expensive than school bus .
The end - to - conference party is going to start from Seven o'clock .
One of our teachers , who will be voted by student is making speech for one hour .
After , student is making speeches about what he or she has learned .
And diners .
In my opinion , you should wear normal clothing .
I would like to suggest that you should visit building of sixty two which is consists of sixty second floor .
There are eye - max cinema , museums , garelty .
This is very famous in our city .
I hope that my advice will help you .
I look forward to hearing soon to you .
Yours sincerely
Pusan Castle
Pusan Castle is located in south of Pusan .
This is the biggest and oldest in Pusan .

Etc .
And there are a lot of facilities in Pusan Castle .

Dear Mrs Maria Smith
With reference to your letter which I received yesterday , I would like to give you some details about the international student conference , also the accommodation and activities that are planned during this week .
The Hotel that is booked for the students it is one of the beast in the area , it has great facilities and it is situated near to the place where the conference is going to be .
The best way to get there from the hotel is by bus and it is already booked for the next day you arrive , at 8:30 am .
About the party which is just at the end of the conference , a good it would be a dance party and the students do n't really need to wear special clothes , it 's just to have a little dance and meet all the students , after the party there is a small trip to the old part of the city and I think it would be a good choice to spend the last three hours that you have left before go back .
I hope this letter answer all your questions , if you want to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter .
Your sincerely
The aim of this report is to give some information about The new Acapulco resort buildings which was built 10 years ago and it is one of the first buildings that was built with the latest technology and made by a important Mexican arquitector .
In addition the resort has an interesting history background about arquitectory and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico for example , it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico .
On the contrary it is far away from the city and it has difficult transport facilities .
In spite of the disadvantages , I would strongly recommend to students and public to visit the new Acapulco resort buildings . and have a great experience knowing about buildings history and at the same time traveling around Mexico .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I am afraid to hear that Mr. Brown is ill
I hope it wo n't be grave .
However , I will be glad to give you as much information as you need and I hope you will find it helpful .
The name of the hotel in which the group is going to stay in is Palace Hotel , to get there you must go to the centre of town , all buses are going there ,
Once you are in the centre Palace Hotel is right in front of the tourism information office .
For the end - to - conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us life music and catering .
Due the hotel is such an elegant place I would suggest to dress up in night clothes .
Finally , to fill your free afternoon I would hardly recomend to visit the cathedral and have a walk round the old part of the city , if you like it will be my pleasure to show you the surroundings .
Yours sincerely ,
Chairs are not only part of the furniture , they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums as art symbols .
Who could have invented such a useful item ?
In fact , nobody has got this clue , but it must have been the most clever person on earth !
The world is packed with so many types of chairs , from the common wooden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable others finding a baste range of prices .
From my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most useful gadget ever invented .
Some people use them in their work , others are wishing to get one by the end of the day and for some other people a while chair represents the possibility of movement .
Although is worth to say that not everybody can chose his ideal chair there is a special one for each of us .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am glad to help you with the organisation of a conference .
I phoned to the tourist information last week and I got some information about the accommodation of the students .
I think we should book at the Palace Hotel .
It is an outstanding building situated in the city centre .
The hotel is in a good position , 10 minutes walk from the conference and I think the best way to reach it is by foot .
I am sure the students will enjoy walking in the streets of the town .
The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm .
I think they should wear smart dress , because there will be lots of interesting people and important meeting .
In conclusion , on the last day , I think it will be very interesting for the students to visit the town and appreciate its monuments and art .
On the other hand , if you prefer to have a relaxing day , you could have a pic - nice in the wonderful park .
I hope my suggestions and ideas will help you to organise the meeting .
I look forward to receiving your confirmation .
Yours ,
REPORT :
TO : MR
OF :
DATE : 21ST JUNE 2000
INTRODUCTION :
As requested , the aim of this report is to assess the suitability of a group of American students for the visit of the Etruscan Museum .
GENERAL INFORMATION :
The museum is situated in the centre of population , the picturesque fishing village on the Etruscan Coast .
Population is about 15 km .
From Piombino and it can be reached by well - organised means of transport .
DESCRIPTION :
The Etruscan Museum is one of the most attractive building in my town .
It contains lots of archeological Etruscans founded and some remains of Etruscans necropolis .
The entrance fee is £ 7 each student .
POSITIVE ASPECTS
1 .
The museum is well - organised by tourists .
There are some shops , café and toilets .
Also there are some free headphones , that explains the history of the museum .
2 . After their visit into the Museum , they could enjoy the superb view of the sea and the tuscan Archipelago , and they could have a pic - nice on the beach .
NEGATIVE ASPECTS
1 .
The negative aspect of the museum is that is quite expensive for students .
CONCLUSION :
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students , I strongly recommend it for their excursion and their interests .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I am writing to give you some information asked in your letter , which I received this morning .
Your group has been booked in Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London .
Personally , I am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities .
It is based in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference .
In my opinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Piccadilly line .
However you would take bus number 150 , if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also .
Regarding to the end - to - conference party , I would suggest to wear some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man , though , it is no formal do .
The party will finish quite late so we 've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the hotel safely .
Basically , during three hour time in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of interesting places in London .
However you would have a long walk along the river to take some essential photos .
I look forward to welcoming you .
Yours sincerely
Are you always happy when your telephone ring ?
As far as I am concerned the telephone was invented in 19th century .
It has been affecting our lives very quickly , although there were some different ways of communication as TV , for instance .
Since the internet was introduced , many of us would n't have imagined the life without this .
We were able even to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for some time .
However , are you always happy when your personal phone rings .
On the other hand I wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you would n't have your mobile switched on .
This invention has affected my life completely .
Since I have been traveling around the world I would have imagined being in tough with my family or friends without internet or my mobile phone .
In spite of having the opportunity of keeping contact with friends at the time we are far away from home , we should have been knowledge how to use it without interrupting others .
Dear Maria :
Thank you for your letter .
I will be pleasure to help you .
The following are some information about the international student conference .
The party will be take place at Palace Hotel .
The hotel is very close Town Hall .

It looks nice and have good meaning .
You can notice every students what they could make some traditional food to the party .
After meal , you can play some games and prepare some gift to the winner .
At the end of conference you can dance and sing together .
There is my suggestion at this party .
If you still have some problems , you can call me .
Love from ,

The Telephone : A great invention .
Imagine your life without a telephone .
Yes , I know , it was just hard to imagine our lives without this invention .
Think about the people living in the time it was invented .
Must had been such a exciting thing being able to talk to someone living thousands of miles for ........ and now for us is just as simple as dial a number and talk to whoever we want to .
Of course is nice to have a phone conversation with friends or family , but the telephone is also very important for business and emergencies .
For example , I work for a bank , and we need to have weekly meetings with our Director living 800 kilometers far , and he does n't have to come here , we just have a phone conference where everybody can talks , and that is it !
What about emergencies ?
A phone call in time for an ambulance can save the lives of many people having a heart attack .
We sometimes do n't realize the importance of some inventions we use in our everyday life .
But think .... , what would we do without them !
Dear Mrs Maria .
I am one of all students and I am going to give you the information , all you need .
We have been booked the hotel for you and the name of hotel is " Palace Hotel " quite near shopping centre .
It is not far away , you just go along Park Road about ten minutes .
Then you will arrive at Palace Hotel on the left hand side of you .
About the end - to - conference party .
We are going to have a dinner before the end and at the end we are going to bring you to the Hotel , you need to wear a night - dress or suit and bow tie .
Finally , on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane so we suggestion , you can go to shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to museam because this museum is the biggest in the world now It is up to you .
Yours sincerely
To group leader
I am a student leader .

On the ground floor , they have a video camera everywhere around the building and police officer walking around the building as well .
Up to the first floor , they have a huge radio room , for sending and receipt the information all over the world because they have a small BBC building all over the world either ;

INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES !
The invention without no doubt , that has affected my own life by far is the car .
Cars have definitely changed all our lives , and I am not referring only in a positive way , but in a negative way as well .
Picture this : a big city such as London or New York with no cars on their streets .
Could you imagine it ?
To be honest , I ca n't .
Cars are part of our daily lives .
Traffic jams make people nervous , sometimes really upset and violent .
But , anyway , people using cars .
If we do n't use them we suffer from them .
In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work
But I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car .
I really need it to escape from the pollution , mainly caused by cars and any other four - wheel motored vehicle .
Is n't that contradiction ?
To go to the countryside and being able to breath fresh , non - polluted air , I use my car , which , as far as I am concerned does not help to maintain a clean air at all .
Therefore I am thinking in selling my car , which has changed my life over the last 10 years , which has given me a kind of freedom , which has gone with me to all sort of fantastic places , and change my life for a new life : whithout car .
Dear Mrs Smith .
I am writing in response to your letter in order to give you some further information about the international student conference in our college .
I would like to inform you that your group has been booked into Palace Hotel .
It is situated in the center of our town and it takes five minutes to get to the college , where the conference is going to be held .
I think that the best choice for you is to take the 234 bus .
The bus stop you should get off is called " The Green Man " .
With reference to the end - to - conference party , which is going to take place on Tuesday from 8:00 until midnight , I would like to mention the necessary dress code .
It was an evening dress for women and black trousers , a white shirt and a black bow tie for men .
Lastly , I would like to give you some suggestions about ways in which you can spend your free time in our town .
I am strongly convinced , that you should visit local Science Museum .
Also there is a very good shopping center next to the museum .
I look forward to seeing your at the conference and hope that you will have a good time in our town .
Yours sincerely
As it is widely known , lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century , nevertheless I believe that the most important one is the computer .
It is a fact , that the modern society have created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information .
Taking it into consideration I would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for the accountants , designers , engineers and so on and on .
Another point in favour is the possibility to connect to the Internet .
It allows you to have all the necessary information " on your fingertips " .
Also not least importantly is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world .
On the other hand there are some disadvantages .
For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world , which computers create .
Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people 's labour , which leads to the increasing of unemployment .
To conclude I would like to say that the governments of all developed countries would n't have been so concerned about so - called " problem 2000 " if the computer had not been so important for the modern society .
Dear Mrs Smith .
I have just received your letter .
It was very sorry news about Richard Brown .
I have given much information about the international student conference .
Firstly , the conference will take place at the Palace Hotel and we get from our college to there by bus .
Number 45 bus runs to there every 5 minutes .
It took 25 minutes that is convenient for us .
Secondly , there are some programmes that are very great .
First time , the conference 's head made a short speech and then we had dinner and drinks .
Finally we enjoy a disco party so you wear a suitable dress .
On the last day I go to your house and then we think about our 's conference plane .
I hope it will be a successful conference .
See you soon .
Yours sincerely
Alice knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .

Dear Mrs Maria Smith :
I am writing to give you the information that you asked me to .
The group has been booked into the Harris hotel .
This hotel is very good place .
From there you can get a taxi , catch the bus seven and eleven ,
With both have you very close to the conference place , and also you can go by underground to get there .
The conference starts at 5:30 pm and it finishes at 8:00PM .
Then , after the Conference , there will be a formal party at the group 's hotel , which starts at 9:00 PM and finishes at 12:00 AM .

How wonderful " light "
We need light every day , not just night time .
We need lamp light in offices or schools or some places during the day time .
How is the wonderful life after invention the light .
Here we just talk about the light we invented apart from nature light .
When I was small , we lived in country yard , I remembered , we used to have oil lamps which used a cotton string dipping in the oil in the small bottle and made it burned the tip of the cotton string to give us light during the night time , it was very little light on , and many things we could n't do under the oil lamps because the light range was very small .
There was no any light outside our house , no light on the road or field either .
I was always very scared whenever or wherever .
Because most places .
Covered by dark , dark and dark .
This scares dark is still affecting my life now .
I never stayed out after dark today except accompanied by my family .
What a big person on the earth , who invented the light , Einstein was .
He created another day time after sunset , people use it to do anything they want to do , We believe we ca n't live without light today , specially in city life , we have a long time to spend for the activities after Sun going to bed .
Which we definitely need light to keep on .
I dare to say , without light , our life will go into a dark , dark hell .

Introduction
The aim of this report is giving some suggestions to a group of American students who has just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit .
Rome is a big city where they can find several moments and important buildings , for this reason I would suggest them to visit
1 ) " Fontana di Trevi " sited in Treviso Square in the center of Rome .
That 's a small square where there is a fountain very big .
It was built by Canvas architect in 1638 .
That is the fountain which " Dolce Vita " film was taking place .
2 ) For other hand , there is Villa Borghese Building , That is a museum where they can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canova and , Bernini , who stayed for a long time working in Rome .
CONCLUSION
I would recommend them the building because :
1 ) First of all , there are sitting in the center of Rome
So , they can take a bus to get them moving and around the city .
2 )
Secondly , they can enjoy visiting museums , and afterwards they can take something to eat or to drink in the " pizzerias ' and restaurants near these famous places .
In conclusion , they could combine art , the history and the night visiting one only place without spending much money .
Dear Marie ,
I am sorry to hear that our friend Mr Brown is ill .
As our conference is due to start next week I respond straight away .
There are some information you have asked me to .
We booked rooms for your group at the Palace Hotel .
That is the best option because it is placing less than 5 minutes walk from the Conference Center .
When you live a hotel you have to turn right and you blew the street .
At the first traffic lights turn right again and you should see a big blue building .
That 's our Conference Center .
At the hotel reception you will find printed information how to get over there .
As you know from the end - to - conference there is a party .
Party is due to start at 8 p.m until 3 a.m.
There is 2hr break between end - to - conference and party .
At this time you and your group can refresh yourself .
I would like to mention that because our conference that is dress - code party .
Hope you will enjoy it .
We prepared some special attraction like live dance music and hot or cold buffet .
About you 're the last question I can suggest to visit the Royal Castle .
That will give you and your guests an impression about our country and history .
Your sincerely ,
In our town there are so many interesting places to see that there is hard to choose one .
In my opinion the most interesting is the Castle .
It is placed on a hill so it is very easy to recognize when is it .
Just look up and you will see that huge building .
Actually it is a whole complex , the Old and the New Castle , Cathedral and the most interesting undergroud part with it 's amazing crypts .
And if you climb to the top of the main tower - the keep you will see unforgetable view on a white town .
After that you can explore our great museum at the Old Castle .
You will find there an amazing collection of old weapon , mores and , we are especially proud of it , the great collection of swords .
After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurants located at the New Castle .
I am sure that should be enough for one day trip .
For you information I can say that at this time we have five weeks festival and this night there will be a great display .
That should complete that amazing day .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday .
I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the information that you have asked me .
Firstly , let me explain the way from the palace hotels , where your group will be staying , to the conference .
The hotel is located in the centre of Seoul , therefore there many ways to get to the conference .
The easiest way to get there is to take the underground , which takes about 20 minutes .
The map will be given to you on the day of your arrival .
Secondly , the end - to - conference party will be held in the Palace Hotel 's Percel Room and starts at 6 o'clock in the evening .
Professor Kim from my college is going to give a speech , and after that dinner will be served .
The party is not very formal , so you can wear any kind of dress , as long as it is suitable for dinner .
Finally , I would like you to recommend a visit to a traditional Korean palace Kong Book for the last day 's free time .
It must be a very interesting visit for the students who have never experienced an oriental atmosphere .
It is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel , and in front of the hotel gate , an airport bus will be waiting for you to take you to the airport after finishing the outing .
I hope you will enjoy your stay in Korea , and do not hesitate to contact me for any further information .

Report on Young Bok Palace - the Glory of Chosun Kingdom .
.
Introduction .
This report provides the information about Kyong Bok Palace , which is highly recommended to visit for visitors from foreign countries .
It highlights the background history and consider the interest of young people , and makes a final recommendation .
.
History .
The kingdom Chosun has a history for 500 years and lasted until the beginning of 20th century .
Kyong Bok palace was the main residence of the royal family , so you will be able to imagine its size .
As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of the nature , the palace had a huge garden , however it was destroyed by the army of Japan , and now there remains only a part of the original palace .
There is a special monument for the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army .
.
Activity .
The reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters , who tends to dislike the historical visit , would be the various activity .
You can try the traditional games of Korea and there is a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the Royals .
Also there are performances which held daily at the front gate of the palace .
.
Final recommendations .
It is out of question not to visit Kyong Bok Palace unless you do not want to know about Korean history .
You will find many interesting points there , therefore , I urge you to visit the place , if you want to experience the tradition of Korea .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions of what you and your students can do during your free time here .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is located in the central area of the city , so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be progressed .
The easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take buses 461 or 176 ( the bus stop is opposite to the hotel ) or we can hire a minibus for you
But there is an extra charge for it .
There is a party on the last day of the conference .
Special awards will be given to students whose reports are the best .
Less of the party is likely to be as our night club so a lot of music , dancing and fun are provided .
Please note that the alcoholic drinks are only sold until 11 pm .
You can wear whatever you like this kind of party .
Coming back to ideas and Suggestions I'v promised to give you about free afternoon befor you catch your plane I can advise you to visit our zoo or to for a picnic in a park befor you will go to the night party .
Yours sincerely ,
Can you see how many inventions you are surrounded by in your life ?
Such a simple and usually things like a telephone , a car , a computer so only seem to be normal and usual for us ( or we have got used ) as we use them every day .
Hundred years before people could n't even use an electric lump not saying about a car or computer .
They have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared , but not every one believes it is really so .
Some people say that many of important inventions in our lives are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them .
First of all they say about environment pollution which cars and other vehicles make , overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others .
But in my opinion if people inventions take a place in our lives they are right then .
I think the telephone is the most important thing in many people 's lives as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone does n't matter wherever you are ( I am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice ) .
Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems .
An electric lamp was an important invention hundred years before ( but by that time it was like a revolution ) .
I think it would n't be possible to survive for us without an electronic life .
Because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries , and an automobile transport is undeniable necessity in our life .
In case of all said I am more likely to think that the benefits of advantages of people 's inventions are much hire the all their disadvantages .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I have just read your letter and I am happy to help by giving you some further information .
According to your first question , about the time of conference the students will be staying at the Palace Hotel , where the reservation has been already made .
It is situated near to our college , about five minutes walk from the nearest tube station , which is South Wimbledon .
As you were informed , there will be a party for all attendants at the conference , which will take place afterwards at the hotel restaurant .
Minding the fact that it will be entirely sociable meeting I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event .
Finally , answering your last question about student 's day - out , I suggest visiting a local Lawn tennis Museums and Wimbledon Tennis Courts as it is one of the best international tourists attractions .
If you have any further questions , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I look forward to seeing you .
Yours sincerely ,

There is also the Portrait Gallery in the left wing of the Palace .
.
The Old Town is the best place for afternoon stroll with a great deal of restaurants , cafes and street performers .
.
There is an easy reach to cashpoints , lavatories , emergency services , etc .
POSITIVE POINTS
.
It is easy to get there by any sort of public transport
.
There are number of hotels or youth hostels to stay overnight , if necessary
.
Most of the admissions are absolutely free .
NEGATIVE POINTS
.
A part of the Palace might be closed , due to the constant renovation .
.
All the facilities are usually overcrowded during a summer holiday .
CONCLUSION :
Despite a few drawbacks , I would strongly recommend the Royal Palace as the most suitable place to visit for the foreign students .

Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am writing to give you some advice from an international student conference .
First of all , the name of hotel which we have been booked into is Palace Hotel .
And we have two choices to get to the conference , a bus or a train .
Both of them are as convinced as getting there .
The day before we will leave there , we have a party which takes place in our hotel .
It is a kind of formal party , so we should be well - dressed .
I suggest that you wear formal dress .
There is some finger foods and drinks .
It might be a great party for end of conference .
End of all , in my opinion we could go a center of the town because there are many places to have a look and go shopping .
It 's quite a nice and a suitable place to spend about three hours .
It could be interesting for them .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Imagine our lives without a telephone .
If a telephone haven't been invented , we would n't have lived perfectly like nowadays .
Would n't you think we rely on it more than we expect ?
A telephone is used when we need to contact with someone , and also an emergency situation and the internet .
It has various ways to use , however , nowadays it is not only used by these purpose , but also it keeps our company .
Even if you feel alone , you can talk and hear from your friends easily .
Then it makes you happy .
Long time ago people live without this perfect invention .
But how ?
They used to keep in touch with someone in a letter .
In spite of taking a lot of time to catch up on , it was the only way .
So that is why they have invented the telephone .
Now we could feel the world closer and closer beaus of a telephone .
Who would n't thanks for this great invention ?
Dear Madam ,
I received your letter and I 'm pleased to answer your questions .
M. Brown have booked rooms in the Palace Hotel .
This is the first class hotels .
The easiest way for the hotel to the conference was on the bus .
There is a bus stop in front of your hotel .
Take the bus to direction enter town .
After four stops got off the bus .
The name of this bus stop is ' Congressman ' .
If you leave the bus , the conference is in the house opposite the road .
You ca n't miss it .
Afterwards we will eat together at a restaurant and we will go on a disco .
For the disco you musn't wear blue jeans .
Finally at your last day I propose you to do a sightseeing tour in our town .
It takes you two hours .
Afterwards you will have any time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland .
If you have any more questions , write me back .
Yours sincerely ,
I will write to the invention of the computer .
With the computer our work is easier and more interesting .
Before the time with computers , people had to write every time a whole letter .
When they would correct a word , they had to write the whole letter again .
With a computer we can write a letter , correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again .
We save the letter and in three weeks we could send it to another person .
I work at a bank and I work all day on computers .
If we hand't day one , we had to write all the transactions on paper .
If I order money for our bank with the computer I can be sure that I will arrive the day after .
But if I had to write a letter and send it by post , the money will arrive two or three days after .
I have never work without a computer , but if we had n't any we would it find normally .
Mrs Maria Smith ,
I 'm pleased to be able to help you for the international student conference .
The hotel in which the group has been booked to is the Palace hotel , which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc .
To get from the hotel to the conference , you have to take the highway indirection of Lausanne , and after nearly half an hour of driving you come out at the place which is indicated with Coppet , Divonne .
When you come out , just go on your right , and then turn left to follow the indications to the Châtaigneroie school .
The end - to - conference party will take place at the same place .
Some musicians will play classical music , and there will be many different drinks and food .
You should wear some formal clothes , but not necessary really pretty clothes
For three hours , you could visit the museum of the Red Cross , which is very interesting .
I hope that these information will help you
Sincerely yours ,
The portable phone , a very useful invention !
During all mankind history , there were discovers who tried to make human life better , but it is in the last century that there were the most biggest discoveries made .
When the phone without cable was invented , one was n't sure if it would be a success or not .
But the research went on , and the portable phone is getting always smaller and more useful .
The portable phone is an important invention , because nearly everybody has one , and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem .
Moreover , some portable phones have a connection to the web , so it is easy to read newspapers if one hasn't enough money to buy it .
Personally , the portable phone has affected my own life , because when somebody is phoning at home , I do n't have to rush to take the phone , being afraid that it 's too late .
I recommend this extremely important invention to those who still do n't have a portable phone .
Dear Maria ,
I would be pleased to help you with all your questions and I will provide you some information which you need as much as I can .
I would like to inform you that Central Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accommodation of the group and it will be quite easy to get every where from the hotel on foot during your stay .
As you know that we arrange an evening party on the third day of the week , we can say that a kind of relaxation time .
Nothing will be spacial .
Place is college garden .
Time is 7 pm .
There is no need to bother with clout .
Everybody can put on something casual .
Before leap from England I suggest you to visit the canals and small villages around Basingstoke .
You could find the opportunity to see country life .
Yours sincerely ,
Time flies
I have to admit that whoever invented the cars and transportation vehicles did the most respectable invention of the word .
I say that it must be the most important thing for us because they save our time passing so fast .
Can you deny how quickly we get somewhere by car or by bus .
May be 10 times as quick as getting somewhere on foot .
Try to imagine your life without having any of them .
Would n't is unbearable and painful .
Certainly it would be just like mine .
Because I live in a rural area far from any village , town , or city center .
The nearest civilization takes me 1 hour on foot .
I had no car , no local bus service to use .
Even coming to Basingstoke seems like an international journey for me .
And cause this stops me everytime to live sociable life .
But also I 'm aware of that time flies for me .
I must do whatever I want before it is too late .
And I have to confess the invention of the car was the most useful inventions of the humanity .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that a group of students from your college have decided to take a part in our international student conference .
As you need more information , I answer all your questions with pleasure .
Firstly , the Palace Hotel has been booked for your group .
It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and situated only half a mile from main building of our college , so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot .
Secondly , our end - to - conference party is included dinner and dancing , I would advise you to wear something not very formal .
Finally , you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historical places ( castles , built in 13-th century ) or art gallery , as well as beautiful Bodnant garden .
I am looking forward to the meeting with you and mutual work during conference .
Your sincerely
There are many different people 's invention around us .
We are so used to them , that sometimes think they existed always .
Some of them are very practical , others are rather strange .
I thing , that one of the most important and affecting our life inventions is the telephone .
Imagine lives without phone .
You are on the road , you have car accident .
What are you going to do without phone ?
On another situation , your son is ill , he needs help urgently .
I am sure , the phone has saved many lives .
Besides , it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum , only for cheating in any time .
Thanks the phone , it is possible even your mam is on the other end of the Earth .
To be honest , next great invention of people , computer , ca n't work , if you haven't got the phone .
So I am very grateful to man , who invented it , fortunately , I have forgotten his name .
It always happens with people , does n't ?
Try to ask who invented the will or the book .
Chêne - Bourg , Tuesday 12th June .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
It is with great regret that I hear of Mr Brown 's illness , and hope to see him soon in an excellent health .
Nevertheless , I am both pleased and honoured to expect you and your group in the context of our international meeting .
We have made arrangements for you to stay at the Palace Hotel .
Furthermore , since it is located between the airport and our location , a bus shuttle has been organised to pick all our guests from the hotel to the conference room .
The end - to - conference party is to be held at the ' Royal Room ' of the hotel , which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness .
Therefore , all guests will be asked to wear the corresponding clothes in order to be accepted .
As for the three hours of free time , I strongly suggest you to check - in your luggage at the airport and then , after a five - minutes bus ride , spend your time in the marvellous ' Old City ' .
Best Regards ,
My fair Mobile Phone .
The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout those last years .
The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect of our ordinary life is , of course , the mobile phone .
It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has become a necessary condition for some professional activities .
Trades , politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs .
However , the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes , when in the hands of a high - school student .
It becomes then a real obsession for the average students , as e uses it before the lessons , during the lessons , during lunch and , especially , during examinations ...
Nevertheless , it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam , since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday 's courses .
Bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student 's phone , but his parents ' !
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
I have just received a letter from you and I 'm writing to you as soon as possible .
I can promise you that I 'll do my best to help you .
You told me that you are the leader of a group of students this year , because Mr. Brown is ill .
Poor Mr. Brown , I hope he will get better soon .
As I 've just checked the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel .
The best way to get from there to the conference is by coaches , that I had arranged for you .
The driver Mr. Olsson works for us since .
He will pick you up at 11 oo a.m.
The conference is from 12 oo at 2
Oo p.m.
At the end of conference is a party from 2 oo to 3 oo .
I suggest you to wear comfortable and nice clothes because I have planned a sightseeing for you before your plane at 8 oo p.m. I 'd like to show you a museum , a gallery and the gardens that are belonging to the palace .
Then we can have a rest in the coffee and talk before your flight home .
I think I gave you all imported information .
I hope to see you all soon ,
Yours sincerely ,
Nowadays motorization is one of the most important inventions .
As you look among everybody has a car or motorcycle .
No matter that people started worrying more about pollution in the world .
Let me to tell you , how invention of motorcycle has affected my life .
I love motorcycles
And I do n't think I could live without them .
I drive motorcycles since I was 16 years old .
Me and my brother we used to go to rock concerts .
We have met a lot of people there same mad about motorcycle as we were .
We were avenging races and trips .
We were driving motorcycles
Few days befour
We finally have got to admitting points .
I really enjoyed driving motorcycles .
People say that is dangerous , I do n't think so .
When I drive is only me and my motorcycle .
Before me and after are my friends that I like and trust .
And around me nature that I can watch and enjoy while we shop fore camp .
We can go to any place we like , avoid traffic and to full buses , trains , etc .
I am really grateful for people who invented the first motorcycle in the world .
I feel very bad about that I do n't know who was it .
On the other hand no matter that I feel very good about that because that invention has changed and affected my life end people I care about , has affected my life in a very good way .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
Thank you very much for your letter .
As you asked me in the letter , I am very happy to help you with finding out details of the conference .
The hotel that your group will be staying at is Palace Hotel .
It is reasonably near to the college , so it may be very good to walk from the hotel along River Thames following yellow signs on sunny days .
If it rains , you can take bus 54 that stops in front of the college .
The end - to - conference party is designed to give rough ideas about many different cultures .
So you will enjoy traditional foods , music , dance and games from all over the world .
As a part of this , the leaders of each group has to wear a costume of her country .
Other members of groups can wear a normal pretty formal dress .
On the last day , I recommend that you will visit the place that is located at the centre of our city .
It is about 1000 years old , so I am sure that you will find it fascinating to see it .
Yours sincerely ,
Can you imagine your life without any computers at all ?
Well , I am sure that you can hardly do this unless you are living deep in a forest or in a dessert !
If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them , it must be clear that invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives .
For example , all infrastructures such as transport and power stations are ran using computers government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country , and all kids of services and businesses such as hospitals and supermarkets use them as essential capitals .
In other words , almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers .
So I am sure from this that it is convincing enough to say that invention of computers is really important .
From my personal experience , I can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool .
It improves productivity of my homework , that is often essay writing , and also it allows me to access to the internet .
Since I live abroad , the internet is really useful for me to have a contact with my best friend and to know what is going on in my home country .
To sum up , I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers that has affected both individuals and a society as a whole .
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
I am writing in reply to your enquiry about this year international conference .
The conference will be held at The Palace Hotel in Old Street .
There will be signs to follow from Central train station .
The conference is commenting on 31st June 2001 at 10.00 - 15.00 .
Light lunch will be provided .
After the conference , there will be a relaxing party .
There is no dressed - code for the party .
However I suggest you could wear the same outfit as you wear for the conference .
I have included the local map , there are some ideas at the back of the map .
Please let me know if you would like to book one of the city - walking tours , We have arrange spacial discounts for the conference attendance .
Personally I recommend the Dicken 's tour because it is a good length of walking and very historical .
I hope that I have covered all information you would need and look forward to seeing you .
Your sincerely ,
P.S. Please find enclosed map .
There are several interesting buildings in the city of London .
I believe Liverpool Street Station is on the top list .
The building itself looked grand and elegant .
Despite the fact that this building has served half - a million commuters in a day , it always clean and functional .
There are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that makes it so interesting building .
The newly decorated section is fairly modern style with escalators and touched - screen ticket machine .
It is also very well linked into the old underground station which it is such a contrast in transformation .
The old bit is rather unique and charming .
You could really imagine how it looked like in the old days .
There is another surprising section of this building .
At the far back of the station is also connected to a spacious well designed pedestrians park .
It is a good example of a great architecture that is designed to provide services to the public .
Finally , it is in the heart of city and everyone would be able to find without doubt .
12 June 2001
Dear Mrs Smith
Thank you for your letter dated 8 June 2001 .
I hope I can give you the information you need .
So the conference will be a great experience for you and your group .
Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel .
The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station .
A free shuttle - bus gets you to the conference - center .
The bus leaves at 8 a.m. at the front entrance of the hotel .
The end - to - conference party is playing in a rent and in the foreground .
There will be a barbecue , a place to dance and many more .
It is a surprise !
I suggest to wear leisure - clothes to the party .
The last afternoon you could go on a city - tour , visiting the museum of Fine Arts or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the common park .
I hoped I could give you some ideas .
I look forward to seeing you .
Yours sincerely ,
What would life be without the phone ?
Have you ever thought of a world without phone ?
How was it in the 18 century with no opportunity to communicate by phone and how would it be now ?
I can not imagine how our lives would be .
We are living in a busy world .
In the business world you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients , to make appointments , to order an article e.c . ; then , time is money !
How has the phone affected my own life ?
I think , that is a good question to think about .
I could not call my friends from the other city and just say " hello " .
It would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment .
So , what did the phone - revolution for us ?
It saves time .
Neuchâtel , 12th June 2001
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I thank you for your recent letter .
First , I would like to congratulate on your new responsibility , because of Mr Brown 's illness .
I give you with great pleasure all the details needed .
Your group is staying at the Palace Hotel , which is located directly in front of the bus station .
To go to the conference from your hotel is really easy .
You have to take the bus number 1 and get off at " Black House " , which is the third stop .
After the conference , at 8 pm .
The party was organised .
During it , everybody will have the opportunity to meet and talk to the speakers at the conference .
Food and beverages will be available .
After the cocktail , the Band " Zero one " is playing their famous songs .
The clothes , required for the party are suits for men and cocktail dresses for women .
Before your departure , you will have time to visit the Olympic Museum or to make a sightseeing tour in our city .
I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference .
Yours faithfully ,
Report on the " Paintings Museum "
In order to write this report , I spent hours in this wonderful museum .
There , I saw the exhibition and admired the building itself .
I walked around the garden too .
Location
The museum is located in Duchy , in front of the " Delamuraz Hotel " .
It is close to the main road , and about 300 meters from the station .
Outside
The building is made of white stones .
It had two floors .
Before going inside , you have to pass through a huge garden .
There , ponds , pools , trees , flowers and ducks can be admired .
I recommend you to take your swim suit , because in summer , it is allowed to swim in pools .
Inside
When you are inside the museum , you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls .
There were all painting during the war by nurses .
If you go down a few steps , you will discover the cellar .
Everything in this room is for wine .
To learn the whole history of the building , there is a room dedicated to it on the first floor .
I particularly recommend you to visit the " blue " room .
Everything in this room is blue , the carpet , the ceiling and even the door .
According to the owner , it is a room where in the past people used to go when they were depressed .
Conclusion
To sum up , I would like to add that this house is the most famous in our city .
You should come and visit it for the paintings or in the building itself .
You wo n't be disappointed .
The only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit .
The house and the garden .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I 'm writing to reply to your letter in which you asked me for help .
I hope I will be able to give you the information you need for a group of students who are coming to the conference .
Firstly , the Palace Hotel is waiting for you and your students .
The best way to get from there to the college where the conference will take place is simply to walk .
Actually , the college is situated 500 meters away from the hotel .
As you know , the conference will be followed by a party .
It will begin at 7 p.m and last until late in the evening .
You do n't need to worry about what you should wear to this event .
In fact , the purpose of the end - to - conference party is to relax after a busy day , therefore you and your students can put jeans and sport shoes on .
To conclude , we decided to organize a guided tour by coach , as you have an afternoon free before your plane takes off .
I hope the international student conference will help to know each other better and that it will be a success .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I 'm writing in reply to your letter in which you asked me information on an interesting building to visit .
There are so many places of interest in Lausanne , but I think that the Olympic Museum is the most notable for the following reasons :
The Olympic Museum date from the 19th century and is the biggest in Europe .
It shows all the different sports men have been doing since the first Olympic Games in Greece .
You can see the evolution of sports and understand why changes gradually have been done to improve them .
You can admire every kind of equipment you need to do any particular sport .
You will be informed about the story of sport in general and for the new technologies which are used nowadays
N high competition .
The museum is near the city center and is accessible by bus or walking .
It will take you an afternoon to visit it and then you can enjoy a drink or a meal in the restaurant on the third floor , well - known for being one of the best establishment in Lausanne .
I hope my recommendations will help you with the choice of a building to visit .
Yours faithfully ,
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I 'm writing in response to the letters we have received from you , in order to let you know all the information you have asked for .
First of all , your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , Main - Road 21 , which is situated not far from our college .
I 'd suggest you to walk , it will only take you about seven minutes .
Just follow Main - Road until to reach a junction , where you turn right and then walk along Denl - a - Lion Road .
The college is a huge , yellow building - you ca n't miss it .
Secondly , you have required information to the end - to - conference party .
It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and lasts until midnight .
All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed to book a band as well .
The location of the party is n't fixed yet , but we will let you know after your arrival .
There is no need putting on special clothes for the party , casual ones should do it as well , for we want everyone to feel comfortable .
Last but not least I will give you some idea of where to spend your free afternoon .
I 'd suggest you to visit our local museum , as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment .
Provided the weather is fine , you could also go swimming or make a tour through our beautiful town .
( I could book a guide for you if you 're interested )
Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need .
I 'm looking forward to meeting you and wish you all the best .
Yours sincerely ,
The telephone , a blessing .
Who of you could imagine life without the telephone ?
Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ?
Not being able to lie to your mother - in - law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?
When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it .
Take me , for example , I use it whenever there is a problem and I need some advice , or when I have to call off a meeting for any reason .
I can not always walk to the person and say " Sorry , I must cancel our meeting " , because then it 's too late anyway , is n't it ?
Life definitely would n't be the same without the invention of the telephone .
We use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on .
Just try to spend one week without using a telephone at all , and you will see that it is impossible to do so .
So do n't take the telephone for granted , but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I would like to thank you for your letter .
I am sorry to learn that Richard Brown could not attend the conference .
Please transmit him my best wishes for his recovery .
We have booked rooms for all members of your group at the Palace Hotel .
It is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building , approximately one mile away .
There is a direct bus link between the two locations : this is bus line number six ; the bus station for the conference building is called " Avenue de cour " and the one at the Palace Hotel is named " Main station " .
Concerning the party we do not have a casual dressing code .
Students usually wear dark clothes with a tie for the boys and a mid - long skirt or dress for the girls .
There are a lot of activities you can do during your free afternoon .
I would like to suggest visiting the " Ethnographic Museum , , which is kind of unique in the world .
Looking forward to meeting you soon
I remain , yours sincerely .
The cars :
I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has the most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries .
Nowadays more than the percent of the world industry is related to the automotive business : car manufacturing , gasoline extracting and refining , tyres recycling , and so on .
The industrial countries have encountered deep evolution of their strictures since the car has been made available to everyone .
At the beginning of the last century only a few very rich people could afford a car ; it was kind of leisure or sport to drive one .
Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities .
The transport network has changed according to this social evolution .
The increased number of cars related and infrastructure are now creating problems .
A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded , and environment issues are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries .
People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without impacting their mobility .
This will be a tough challenge in this new century .
Dear Mrs Smith :
My name is Juniper , I am helping to organise the conference in the college .
I received your letter the other day and I am writing to answer your questions .
The group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held .
You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference , it only took ten minutes approximately .
As for the end - to - conference party , it will be on the morning of the last day starting at 9:00 .
All the students and staff will join together in the hall .
They can play games and talk about personal experience .
The main aim of it is to deepen the friendship among all these pupils coming from all over the world .
So it would be fine if you wear casual clothes and look smart .
I had made arrangements for the afternoon of the last day for you .
If you are free I will show you around our college .
You can visit our newly - built science lab as well .
I 'm sure you would acquire a lot of knowledge there .
I 'm looking forward to meeting you .
Best wishes .
Best choice
Welcome to London .
You asked me for an interesting building to visit .
In my opinion , I 'll recommend British Museum .
One of the reasons is you can learn almost everything about British history there .
The museum looks very old as some other buildings in London , but it is very modern inside .
After going through the enormous main door , you can see a huge white round building which is a library .
A lot of famous people have been to this library before !
The British Hall is on the first floor , not far from the library .
It shows a large number of valuable things .
Almost each one tells you a story or gives you a picture of British history .
I 'm sure all the students will gain a wonderful lesson !
Apart from the national history , there are more content in the past of the world .
You can go to many sections such as Asia Hall , Egypt Hall , Europe Hall and so on .
Countless fascinating things will definitely take you a whole day to appreciate .
After a visit to British Museum , you will be certainly able to put your history textbook away !
Also you do n't have to pay any money for it , and the transport is extremely convenient , therefore British Museum is your best choice .
Do n't be hesitant any more !
Dear Mrs Smith .
I am writing to you to give you the information about the conference .
The hotel your group has been booked into is called Palace Hotel .
It is simple to find the way to this hotel for the conference .
You only need to cross the street in front of your hotel .
There you will find a modern building with two different doors a red and a blue one .
You are asked to take the blue door .
After entering you will see the sign conference room .
We organized the end - to - conference party on the day before your departure .
Everyone is welcome to join this party to get to know each other in a good atmosphere .
You should wear nice and comfortable clothing .
This is an informal party .
I suggest you visit the old part of Zurich or going to the zoo before your departure .
I am looking forward to meeting you at the conference .
If there was any question left , please contact me .
Yours sincerely ,
The Most Important invention
I love baking cakes , cookies and bread .
Baking is passion and in the town I live I 'm known for making the best cakes in the area .
It does n't matter in what kind of mood I am , I can do it all the time and it makes me feel good .
But I could n't bake without an oven .
I 'm so grateful for this invention which allows me to live my passion .
I think the oven is one of the most important inventions .
If there is someone who does n't agree with me , he or she should try to live one month without using the oven .
Besides that he or she should look carefully into what he or she buys .
I 'm positive that after such an experience everyone says that the oven is a really important invention for our lives .
I 'm thanking the person who invented the oven .
Thank you !
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
I am writing to reply to your letter .
I am sorry for Richard Brown .
And I understand that you need help , so that I will help you as far as I can .
Firstly , the hotel which ha been booked for you is Palace Hotel that is located close to the conference .
In order to get from the hotel to the conference , you just need to take the bus we will offer .
Secondly , the end - to - conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6 p.m. , which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference .
The party is arranged as a casual party , therefore , you can wear comfortable clothes .
You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well .
Finally , if you want to have an exciting experience in here , I strongly suggest that you go to the musical .
As you may hear , our city is well known for the musical .
Or , if you want to relax , you can take a walk in the park situated in ten minutes distance on foot from the hotel .
Whatever you choose , you will be satisfied with your choice .
If you have more questions about the conference and something else , do not hesitate to ask me .
I would be glad to be able to help you .
Yours sincerely ,
Some inventions are not regarded as great things even though the life without them could not be imagined .
People do not have the impression on important inventions any more , because they have been getting more popular and common .
However , there is something which is still believed that it was an extremely important invention .
This is electricity invented by Edison .
From my point of view , the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines , appliances and equipment which are used in modern times can be operated with only electricity , which makes people not to too much physical labour .
What is more , many inventions have been accelerated by electricity .
In my life , I use electricity in many different ways .
At night , I can study because of it . and
Also It saves my time which would be used up for doing housework such as laundry , cleaning rooms and ironing .
It makes my life more convenient than that without it .
To sum up , although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention any more , the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not be changed .

Dr Mrs. Maria Smith ,
I am very glad to help you with the International Student Conference .
I hope that our friend Richard Brown does n't have any serious illness .
Referent , where is the conference .
This will be in the Casino Hotel and we do n't need to worry for the best way because in all the main routes in Devonport have signs with correct way to the popular hotel .
After finishing the conference , there was a party in same hotel .
In this party there are ; some foods , soft drinks , music and a special place for dancing .
This party is for the students so the kinds of clothes wo n't be so formal .
On the day free before catching our plane .
We could choose two options on spending our free time .
One is a guided tour of center city , and another is visiting a chocolate factory .
Please , if you have any more questions , please call me at 38755980 .
Yours sincerely ,
I can live without this .
It 's true .
In our life , may be , could n't were without electricity .
Some people can live without this , but I am sure that the world would be very different .
When we are using different equipment in our houses , we are using the electricity .
Small things but very important in our lives .
For example : T.V. , computer , just light and a long list that now I can not write .
I do n't like thinking , my house in my life , without all this facilities .
In winter when is dark very early , and after , I need to spent my free time at home .
What I can do without my music and my computer .
Now , just you need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city , with a car , aeroplanes , shops , all these things without lights .
Finally .
I think that everybody knows that the electricity is very important invent and for me it is the best .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Thanks for your last letter and I am sorry for not giving you enough information .
We have already booked a 4 star hotel - Palace Hotel , which is near the River Thames , in Walton - on - Thames .
It is not far away from the station so we will go there by train .
The end - to - conference party will be held in an India restaurant , that is next to the hotel .
It is supposed to be held during 7 pm to 11 pm .
Also there are some competitions and exciting games after dinner and disco is also provided .
You can wear anything you like , we would like you to be just yourself and have fun .
As you know , our area is quite famous and lots of people come and visit it every year .
There are so many things to do , unfortunately , there is just 3 hours .
I recommend the high street in the centre of our area because it is quite good for shopping .
So you can buy gifts for your friends or family .
I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some doubts , please do not hesitate to contact us .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
Nowadays , our lives are becoming better and better .
Lots of great inventions have been invented in order to make people live comfortably .
If you ask me which is the greatest invention of all , I will say that it is the television .
" television is just an amazing invention .
" My good friend said that .
I agree with her .
Firstly , televisions make us know more about the world without travel it all .
If there are no televisions , we wo n't know what are the other countries like , or even what language they speak unless we go to that country .
Secondly , at some point , it can educate young children .
Many TV programmes are especially made for children , such as " Learn follow me " and " Be good to others " .
Actually , they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child .
The last but not least , it is a good kind of entertainment .
Maybe you will think that playing basketball , going to cinemas and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object .
However , televisions can bring you the fun that other activities ca n't .
If sometimes I do n't want to go out
And I do n't want to be lonely , that 's easy , just turn on the television and enjoy myself .
However , everything has its advantages and disadvantages .
Personally , I do think television is the most important invention .
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith .
I got your letter this morning and I am very pleased to give you some information .
As I know , he booked the Palace Hotel in downtown .
When you go to the conference , you can take a bus or a taxi .
But if you have enough time , I would like to recommend to walk .
Because there are a lot of beautiful trees and you can see the sea .
And also it takes just fifteen minutes .
I think everybody can enjoy it .
By the way the end - to - conference parties is a kind of farewell party .
There will be three parts .
The first part , the chairman and a few guests will have a speech and the second part , the participants will evaluate themselves , and the the last part it will provide dinner and drinks .
It will be not too formal party .
So you can wear what you like .
Moreover , I would like to recommend ' City tour ' for three hours .
Everybody enjoyed themselves .
It is £ 12 each and there is a reduction in groups .
I hope it will be a good tip for you and if you have any problem , you can contact with me any time .
And having a nice time in my town and send my regards to Richard .
Yours sincerely ,
Nowadays there are a lot of inventions around the world , and they make us more comfortable and convenient .
Moreover we could not live without them .
For example : electricity , computer , telephony , boat , and car ( wheel ) , etc .
None of them are unimportant for us .
But I think the invention of electricity is the most important thing among them .
If you look around at home , there are a lot of electric things .
Electricity could be able to invent other things .
It also gave us more free time , especially for women .
It has absolutely reduced women 's our house working time .
Even more we can enjoy our night lights .
If we want do something , we can do it at night same as day .
Finally the quality of our life is changed by electricity .
It could reduce our working time and make us enjoyable .
It is also advancing more and more .
It will give us better future !
Have you ever imagined that you would drive electric car !

From : Julie
The aim of this report is to describe the Haunted Castle in Camberley .
Place
This castle is situated in the centre of the town and surrounded by woods .
Inside of the castle is always dark even in daytime .
Story
It is 500 years old , and it is said to be haunted by a lady ghost .
She appears occasionally and opening every window in the castle .
It is believed that she was a nanny who worked there and fell out of the window .
People said she was seeking something and still seeking even if she had dead for 500 years .
Conclusion
The ghost story may not be true , but it has good furniture of 16th century , and the castle itself is very beautiful .
I think it is worth while to see .
I hope you 'll enjoy visiting there .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I have received your letter this morning .
I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to attempt the conference ; I am glad that you are able to be the leader of the group .
I hope that these information below are very useful to you , during your attempt at conference .
I have booked a hotel not far off from our school .

There will be a coach waiting for you , and the driver will be next to the information desk .
You should arrive at the hotel by 11:00 .
You will than have an hour to check in and unpack all your luggage .
The conference will start on time at 12:30 , so I would suggest you to leave hotel by 12:00 .
The best way to get to the conference is to follow along the collage road and turn left toward the end , you than keep going straight , you will eventually see the main entrance of the collage .
When you get into the college you can just ask any boys in the college where to go from then .
They all know where the conference is and when .
At the end of the conference , we will have a party .
The party is to let all the students to know each other better .
The party will be in the dance hall next to the conference room .
I would suggest them to wear formal clothing , as in tie , trousers and blazers .
For the afternoon free time on the last day .
There are a wide variety of choices that they can do .
They can play tennis , do athletics , swimming ... and many other sports event in our school , if they want to .
Or they can also visit the Epsom Town .
There are shops which sales clothing , food , and books ...
They can decide what they want to do , it 's entirely up to them .

Dear group leader ,
Welcome to Taiwan .
This report is based on an interesting building , where you can take , for your students to visit .
This building is situated in Taipei , the capital .
The building is called Chiang Ken - she Memorial Hall .
Nearly everyone knows where this building is , so if you have a chance , just ask the local people in Taipei in this building .
The memorial hall is surrounded by large playground .
As you go into the main hall , you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kei - she , this is because the building is the remembrance of how well Chiang did in History .
The statue is about 20 feet high .
Next to the statue is protected by the guards , the guards will change every four hours .
Apart from the main hall , there are also lots of other galleries .
In these galleries there are Historical paintings , antique furniture which Chiang used .
These treasures are very old , even older than the history of America .
All these treasures were brought over to Taiwan by Chiang during the defeat in China .
They are all being well looked after .
As well as all the treasures , statue and historical paintings ... There are also restaurant 's and modern galleries .
When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat , or if you are fed up with historical thing , you might as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern .
Finally , if you went to visit this building I will recommend you to stay at a hotel not far from the memorial hall called Hyatt Hotel .
It only took about five minutes if you walk .
I hope you will all have a great time in Taiwan and I hope you will enjoy the building .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I have received your letter dated on the 12th June 2001 .
I am very happy to help you and I hope that the information , that I am going to give you , will be enough .
The international student conference will be at the Palace Hotel in Lausanne .
The Hotel is a big building in the middle of the town near the place " St - François " .
And the name of the street is " Grand - Chine " .
You could not miss it .
After the conference , we are going to stay in the Palace Hotel but instead to stay in the conference room , we are going to move to the reception room where a dinner will be prepared for us .
Afterwards , a live band was going to play the rest of the night .
For the clothes , you have to wear something smart and classic .
If you want to stay in Lausanne during your afternoon free , the best thing to do is to go to Ouch .
There , you can enjoy the landscape and have a sunbathing .
Your sincerely ,
OLYMPIA MUSEUM
The aim of this report is to give further information on an interesting building to visit in Lausanne .
It is based on my own experiences .
WHY THE OLYMPIC MUSEUM .
The Olympique Museum is situated near the lake and offer , for the tourist , an unbelievable view on the mountains and the lake .
But also , the museum has a lot of gardens with several statues .
Besides , the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern .
First of all , the main interest of the museum is the Olympic history .
You can find a lot of documentary about it and you have several competitors personal objects .
In addition , you can play with several interactive games and learn about the rules of the Olympic games .
REASONS FOR RECOMMENDATIONS .
The principal reason is the cheapest price .
You pay only to FRS in the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want .
On the other hand , if you are more than 10 people , you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person .
It seems that this solution might be the best way to visit this museum .
CONCLUSION .
To sum up , the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group .
Therefore , if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games , it must be the best place for this .
Dear Maria ,
I 'm so happy to help you with this international student conference .
I 'm afraid of Richard .
Could you please tell him my best wishes to health ?
I 'm sure you can perfectly replace it to lead your group .
At first , you should know that you are booked into the Palace Hotel that is one of the best in the town .
The access to the conference place is very easy .
First of all , you must walk down to the Central Street until you arrive at the bus stop , then you take the bus number two that goes directly to the college .
After the conference , there is a great party that is organised by friends .
It starts at twenty o'clock until the end of the night , so be ready !
There is no special theme for the wearing style but it should be more fun if you wear something crazy ...
Finally , I propose you to go to the new college swimming on the last day afternoon .
Every body will go there .
I hope you will have fun !
Yours sincerely
Hello ,
I will give you some information on the overdone 's castle .
This building is one of the oldest that stays in the landscape of the town .
I think its important to see it when you come there because it shows us how the town had been developed around it since its creation .
Those days , the castle is being remade , so there is a lot of construction engines around it .
That 's not a big problem because there is a complete museum in it where you can see old pictures of the castle during the centuries .
There is a lot of old items that were in the King 's family .
You should have probably heard about the mummy who sleeps there for about two thousand years ...
You can see it in the dungeon .
So you can visit everywhere you want with or without a guide .
I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holliday in Yverdon .
Best regards ,
Dear Mrs Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
I will try my best to answer the questions .
First of all , we have already booked the Five - Stars Hotel in your group .
It is a modern hotel , near our college , and it is also very convenient to come to the airport .
You can take both for buses or taxis .
The number 101 bus starts from the airport , than you can get off with " city college " stop .
It would be a great chance to talk part of the party for everyone .
This is just a relaxing party , just for the members have a chance to relax and make friends .
So I think you 'd better wear a dress .
Finally , about the free three hours , my personal prefer to go shopping .
Our city has got the biggest shopping centre in South England , there gathered so many shops .
It Worth to spend time and money on that .
I look forward to seeing you !
Yours sincerely
Nowadays people have become used to watching television 's programming everyday .
The TV is so important that you can see it in every family , and it is the essential equipment for everyone .
First of al , in my opinion , TV has a great education functions , and also makes the world become small .
You can just sit at home then you can know what is happening all over the world at the moment .
I would rather watch the news on TV in stead of reading in newspaper or hearing on radio because the news on TV are vivid .
Moreover , the TV is a great company with the people who live alone or feel alone .
I would like to open TV when I stay at home .
Someone was talking , laughing , crying on there , so join them , you will feel much better than just yourself .
Some TV programs are enjoyable !
However , TV also has some disadvantages .
You might just sitting in front of TV for hours learn nothing , or no more talk with your family .
I think this is a bad influence for the society .
In conclusion , the TV has both advantages and disadvantages , but on the whole advantages is greater than disadvantages .
So , but on the whole , TV still is a wonderful and important invention in the world .
Dear Mrs Smith ,
I am writing to you to give you more information about an international student conference .
The group has been booked into King Hotel at High Street which is very easy to find .
And the best way to get from there to the conference is following the rod in front of the hotel to the right , then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side .
After that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference place which is called White House .
At the end of conference , we are going to have an International Dinner as well as some shows from the students in my college .
As this is a special conference so you could wear your own national dress to present your country .
Finally , on the last day you could spend your free time to visit our town hall which you will be able to learn more about my area - or do some shopping at High Street .
If you want more information , please contact me and I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Mr. Bill ,
I am writing to give the information to a very interesting building to visit .
It is called Penrhyh Castle , as the building will tell you all about Wales .
On the positive side , you and the group will be able to learn more about Welsh art works which are presented on the wall , on the door and some furniture .
The building itself looked splendid and beautiful .
On the other hand , you might find something which is very boring such as walking along the old wooden floor which causes some noise .
And some old toilets might look awful .
But in my recommendation , I think it would be nice for the students to come and see this building .
Because they will be able to learn and compare with a place in their country .
As Wales is not modern like America , so the students will probably get the idea of looking back to the old things .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Mrs Maria Smith .
I was really pleased to receive your letter .
Unfortunately Richard Brown is ill but I can help you as much as I can .
So , I 'm writing to reply by giving all the information you asked for .
Firstly , we 've booked Palace Hotel , which is located in Central .
The best way to get from the hotel to the conference its using tube because it takes only 20 minutes .
The tube is 2 line which is red colour .
And your speech would be better for the end of conference party .
I 'd suggest you to wear at least , semi formal wear such as a jacket with another clothes .
Finally , I give you some suggestions which could spend for about 3 hours in the national museum in my area .
The museum can be helpful to understand our country 's history and art .
I look forward to seeing you soon .
Yours sincerely ,
Computer is the most important invention in our lives .
Some people might say the electricity more important than another thing .
It 's hard to say which is the most important invention .
However , I 'd say computer is more amazing invention rather than another inventions such as the telephone , the car .
Recently computer is really necessary and we ca n't manage to work without them .
Not only is for business , but also in my life .
For instance , when I want to contact with my friend , it 's quite helpful by using e - mail .
Before computer had been invented , we could n't possibly have lots of information easily and we could n't contact with to foreign countries at the same time .
And also it 's time to make new system which makes us use easier and more simple , so far more people can enjoy computer more than before .
Despite amazing invention , some times computer makes big problem , such as millennium bug ( some people called " 2000 problem " ) , because computer not flexible enough like a human 's brain .
However , computer is worth to use in our life until more convenience machine will be invented .
Dear Mrs. Smith ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am very pleased to give you the information you requested .
We are holding a conference party at the Royal Lancaster Hotel - banqueting room at 2.00 pm on Sat .
24 June .

As you know , we 've been working very hard all this term .
So we 've decided at the end - to - conference party , we will have a buffet and a disco party .

I would suggest everybody to wear casual dress .
Finally , I would recommend you and your group to enjoy shopping and sightseeing around Oxford Street and nearby .

It upgraded the building every year .
The Barbican Centre is a very important building in London .
You and your group will visit one building which has so many places in this building .
So that you could spend your time in one go .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith
Thank you for your letter which arrived me this morning .
Of course it is a pity that Mr. Brown has been ill , but we are happy that you are coming now .
You asked me which hotel group had been booked .
It is the Palace hotel , about a mile away where the conference will take place .
The best way to get there , is to take the bus number 7 .
The bus stop is opposite the entrance to the hotel .
You will leave the bus at , , Royal gardens " .
Turn left and go straight to , , Baker street "
At the need of this street there is the house number 18 .
This is our colleges .
You wish to know all about , , the end - to - conference party .
As far as I can see there will be only a little dinner and a group of young singers will surprise us by their songs .
Moreover you ask what to wear .
Do not bother .
I would recommend you wearing some casual clothes , like jeans , a blouse or a skirt and a jacket .
Dotson forget to wear a pair of comfortable shoes , because you will not have chance to change it .
Finally I give you some advise on what you could do for about three hours .
Firstly we have a nice and interesting museum , it is located near the hotel .
Furthermore there is the zoo with a lot of different animals , located to walk within five minutes .
Lastly there is also a very old and famous church , with many coloured windows .
For further information please call me up .
I hope you will have an interesting conference here .
I am looking forward sees you
Yours sincerely
The telephone a very important invention
In my early childhood my mother said to me that when she has been a little girl there has been only one telephone in the house where she had lived .
It has been in her parents ' apartment .
The neighbours had come into to make their calls and to get their calls .
Today nobody could imagine such a situation .
In every household there is a telephone at least .
There are a lot of advantages for it .
Firstly people are able to talk to people about every time .
Be it : just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins .
Moreover we always can call for help from the police , to the hospital or to a doctor .
This could save lives !
An other advantage is that all offices , firms and industries could not further exist without it .
Of course there is also a big disadvantage .
All people know this situation ; people want not to be interrupted , maybe they are reading a book , having a good talk or are having a little sleep ...
Then the telephone rings ... !
It is not an easy decision how to react now .
Is sincere , most of us would go for the telephone .
Another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing .
Everywhere and in every time .
Especially youngsters misuse this kind of invention .
To sum up this invention is one of the most useful things .
It is always the same how people use it or not and how people handle it .
Dear Mrs Maria Smith
Thank you for your letter , which arrived yesterday .
I hope to give you , all the information need and please , if you want more information or something is not clear , please do n't hesitate to contact me again .
The hotel is near the station and is called " Grand Placed " .
When you arrive you take the train at Guildford and after you have just across the road , in front of the station .
It 's very comfortable hotel where you can find everything you need .
From there to the conference you have to take the bus number 50 , that stop near the hotel and arrive in town center .
The conference is organised by the civic hall so it is very simple to find it .
At the end of conference there is a party a perfect opportunity for your students meet new friends from all part of word and they could speak about their experience .
I suggest for that conference to wear something very comfortable but elegant , the organisation want for all boys wear jacket , the tie is not necessary .
I do n't know rely what you can see , three hours I think is not enough but near the station there is a beautiful garden popular for its variety of flowers .
If I find something special to visit in three hours I call you .
Your sincerely
Dear Ser or madam
It is very nice of you to come and visit my town .
In that area there are a lot of things you can see and some interesting building to visit .
The best building you must see is the cathedral .
It is the more important church in that area for its architecture .
It is something very particular , its impairment made from many small species of wood , its windows with many colours , it is fantastic .
It was built on the top of the hill and around there is only a huge field .
You can arrive here walking because the bus stop just at the bottom of the hill .
But really you must see it , the position of the cathedral give you a something special a big tranquility .
I hope you like it .
I look forward to hearing from you
Best regarded
Dear Maria ,
I hope that all the information you need would be answered satisfactorily .
First of all you have been booked at the palace hotel .
Secondly the best way to go from the hotel to the conference center is to use one of the shutel buses we provide to this effect .
They are going to leave at 9 o'clock .

Dear John ,
In your previous letter you asked information about interesting building to visit in my country .
There are plenty of churches , cathedrals , and old cottage .
The church and the cathedral is very interesting because of their different Romanian styles .
I suggest you visit first the cathedral of " Le Feu d'Mrgell " because it is the most emblematic building in the area .
If you are interested in more modern buildings I can suggest you to visit " Caldea " which is a very modern bath centre with a beautiful architecture .
Finaly if none of my suggestion fit with yours expectations , let me know more about what kind of buildings you are interested in and I 'll do all my best to find something more suitable .
Best regards
