S I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the ' international arts festival . '
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , there are some points which can be improved for the next year .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To begin with , you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in fact their were only six countries involved .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries .
A 2 3|||R:PREP|||at|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore is that some concert halls were definitely to small or in other words to many people attended those concerts .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This kind of problem you could avoid when you look for big halls at the begining .
A 15 16|||R:NOUN:INFL|||beginning|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another point where you could improve is when you show more plays and films next year .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea with the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attemp a whole weekend for a cheap price .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Anyway the people where asked this question probably found out that it is n't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes to much work .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A traditional way to earn money , in the spare time , is to bring newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The problems that you have here is the weather .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example when it is rainy , because then everything get wet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help for changing the film rolls , for cleaning the toilets or to do some other small jobs .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you 're good at , I mean if you 're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If you go to the centre of every big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But shopping is not always enjoyable .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all because of the big variety in the store .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from , not , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike , adidas or Fila .

S And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping is n't always great fun , but the last cause , which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me , no one to talk to and noone to complaine .

S I 've been recently seeing in your theatre during my week 's holiday in London I must say I had a very disappointing evening !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was sure this was the London 's newest and best musical show I had ever seen because of the good publicity you made in your advertisement , but I thought completely wrong !

S Firstly , the play started nearly an hour later as I expected !

S The main actor , Danny Brook , was changed and the one who played his part was n't as good as I expected .

S We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Lastly , I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using .
A 13 14|||R:SPELL|||utilities|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot , a machine , or something other with the same purpose .

S Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen , it will still be filled with vegetables and meat .

S This is because people wo n't miss the great taste of food although it could be subsituted to a vitamin pill or two .

S I believe , that if somebody wants the fame and the glory must be tottally sure about the results .
A 14 15|||R:SPELL|||totally|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , the politicians the have choosed their careers , they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have bad reputation , and they will be not trustworthy .

S Nowadays , we have all kind of instruments to washing up the dishes , to cook to be more comfortable , for example the TV , the video recorder , etc .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A 37 38|||R:MORPH|||lives|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We will be able to accelerate the process of the computer 's games for example ...
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I mean I do n't think we 'll change cars by aereoplanes ...
A 11 12|||R:SPELL|||aeroplane|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Why people like so much go shopping ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family , so for them , shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Othrewise , there are people who think the opposite ; such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they go to buy hardly ever , only when they need clothes or something for their job or school .
A 0 1|||R:SPELL|||Otherwise|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In that way shopping can be as funny as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0
