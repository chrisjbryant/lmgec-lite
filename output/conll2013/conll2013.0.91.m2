S Therefore , surveillance technology provides convenience to the society but makes more inconvenience to individuals .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , surveillance technology can be used but the use of surveillance should be modified in such a way that individuals are less affected in normal life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In general , surveillance technology benefits the society and should be applied with the consideration of individuals ' life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Surveillance technology could cause everyone to feel paranoid and as if our actions are being watched .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If everyone is being watched unknowingly , it seems that our freedom of doing things is being invaded .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Technology can be a very useful tool if being used in the correct manner .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It may be a help to prevent potential crimes from happening but also help people do crime .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The knowledge of installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes can be eliminated instead of increasing it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We do not want to be sued infringing other 's privacy , therefore , before implanting any RFID , we should ask for other 's consent .

S RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purpose , it is also used to track people by doing human implants .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is unacceptable for some people in the society , however , I think this application is necessary and provides the society a lot of benefit .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Surveillance technology such as RFID has been used to track people may help to reduce the number of people who get lost .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , there are always news on newspaper , report that some elderly get lost at certain place and their family are looking for him or her .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly , and with the help of police office , maybe they can find the elderly back , but it will take a long time , and a lot of energy to find someone in a country has a population about five million without knowing the exact location of that person .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , if the elderly has been implanted with RFID devices , then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device differently .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals ; therefore find the location of the lost elderly in a shorter period of time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Surveillance technology such as RFID is not only useful to track the lost people but also useful to prevent the trading of children which happens in many developing countries .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It may be known that young children may be stolen by some agency that doing the business to trade the children .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , they may wait in the public area and wait for parents to bring their children out but did n't pay attention to the child , so that this kind of agency may bring the child to mountain area and sell him or her with a good price .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Since this may happen across province , and without any clue about the path that the child may went through .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , if the child has been installed with tracking device , more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Not only the details of location will be provided , but also may lead to find out the root of this kind of children trading agency and it helps to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen on any family .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S No matter how good and how many security systems are there for us , the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and breaking the codes of the security system .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , I think RFID can be useful when comes to appropriate handling and usage .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , this can be a very beneficial and useful device for police force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements , or contributing to more leads for solving a case .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But before the application , governments need to secure safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people , it is my opinion , that , such technology should rethink its way of existence .

S In fact , people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world-the internet .

S The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking on people 's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Such incident happened in London a few years ago , when the government installed CCTV ( ) on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order .

S From this case , we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some way , however , when it touches the privacy of people themselves , it is unacceptable .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S From the point of humanity , it is inhumane to use such technology on human beings .

S It is understandable that once people have human implants , they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily traced out .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Surveillance technology is one of the main concerns of military and national defense sectors .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Example of this technology is RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and cons .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , everyone in the world belongs to themselves who does not belong to anyone from my personal perspective .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Human rights were raised up pretty frequently in the world over the past few years .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Approval of RFID tracking will be seen as a violation of human rights and people will lose their most basic freedom .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Would not it similar to criminals in prison but in a bigger confined space ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The chip identifier technology can be reproduced by anyone .

S It represents a query : is not everyone can view each other 's information such as name and age ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The leakage of these confidential information can be a sensitive issue to personal , violation of freedom and breakdown of safety .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the examples is the storage of bank account number in the tracking chip .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Criminal could identify it easily by getting a small identifier anywhere and everywhere if the tracking proposal is approved .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He or she could easily touch on the designated bank account since password cracking is an easy task for most hackers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Other than that , safety issue can be extended to personal safety .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Everyone knows the internet and data transmission are very common and accessible at any time and point such as Facebook .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , people tend to express their personal feeling and idea about sensitive issues on the internet unintentionally .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This action could actually generate aggressive feeling from others and violent movement could be launched onto the one with the aid of tracking tag or implant .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Internet can be a convenient source to achieve the name and basic information of personal if it is hacked and the tracking proposal will facilitate the finding of designated person .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition , the national defense will be endangered if this tracking proposal is launched .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The technology is based on the chip implant or tag .

S However , the chip implant can be retrieved out easily and replanted onto other people and so on the tag .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Mischief cases could actually cause a chaos on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it ill-intentionally .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , a wanted person can escape out easily from a country and hide in another country with this method .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This tracking proposal creates a loophole in the net of justice rather than its original purpose .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In a nutshell , surveillance technology may provide a lot of convenience if being used appropriately .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , it is fairly fragile which can be counter-used by criminals at current level .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I would stand against the idea of tracking individuals given its vulnerabilities of technology at present .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nowadays , the improved human technology online is able to track different location for different people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , face book as the well known social media platform has the ability of tracking someone 's location .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , in some opinions , these auto-tracking services break the rule of privacy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some people do not want to be tracked as they feel it is not safe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In my opinion , the developed surveillance technology can be used to track people and objects only if the tracked person agrees to receive this service .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There exist various advantages of using the surveillance technology .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The first example will be to track your personal items and prevent from losing it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We all know that there is an application on iphone called where is my iphone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It basically served to allocate your iphone 's position at any single time , For instance , if someone left his phone in a certain place , he can check his phone 's location by searching through the internet using another phone that has the same application if you are connected with your friends ' device .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You are able to find the location of your lost iphone by asking your friends as all the shared devices are able to see the location of each other .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another good example of using tracking technology will be to find a way to the place that someone has never being there before .
A 20 21|||R:VERB:FORM|||been|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , one person wants to visit his friends place in a new city .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S His friend is able to upload his location due to this advanced technology .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Then , the person is able to use GPS or other auto-tracking device to find the place even he has never gone to there before .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The radio-frequency device can be used on old people whose memory is not as good as young people as well .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , when people getting old , they begin to loss their memory and sometimes they may not remember their way to home or other place .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If the old people always bring an auto-tracking device , it is much easier for the younger people to find them and it helps to guard the safety of the old people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although the auto-tracking device is quite powerful , it still has to be used in volunteering bases .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Without the agreement , people should not able to use this technology to track others .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , if the tracking technology is able to track everyone even strangers , this means your location at anytime is viewable to every single person online .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These kind of situation will cause crime as thieves may auto track you and you are not able to run out of them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , we must agree with the statement before the technology is able to track us .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S At the same time , our location should be protected from seen by the strangers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All the conditions must be agreed by the person that agrees auto-tracking device to track him like , the time of tracking and who can view your location .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , the advanced technology gives people convenience to find their items and their safety .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S At the same time , people must protect their privacy without share their place to strangers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Overall , the benefit of these technologies overweight its problems occurred if people use it wisely .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The increasing in population of a country makes the government taking more difficulties of registers the members of each individual family and hence other factors existed as an obstacle of country development .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S By following the trend of improvement in technology , people can now easily tracked by using RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) by simply implant a RFID tags on human body .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With this advantage , it will be easier for people to locate his friend or his family when they lost contact or in an urgent and also for police to investigate crimes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S By taking an example in any country , there are crimes everyday and it is obvious to see that not all the culprits had been arrested and being punished .

S There is only 10 % of all the time of successfully pinpointed the kidnappers den and arrested all of them before they starts to harm the poor victim .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In that sense , without a proper way to track human being , it is way too difficult to save those innocent life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , not only the kidnappers and the victim need to be tracked down , but also jailbreakers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Few years ago , there was a jailbreaker named Mat Selamat , one of the members of the terrorists of Osama , successfully escaped under the monitoring of a couple of cops in Singapore .

S People fell into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but keep claiming that their country is still in safety mode .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If RFID comes into existence , this kind of cases can be totally avoided in no time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Beside , if RFID is supposed to be use by the public , everyone will be able to locate their friends and also their dearest family .

S With the help of RFID , if there is an urgent that people crying for help , they would be saved .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , RFID benefited people more than brought harmful side effect to human body by considering for human safety .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thus , let 's us discuss the pros and cons now to give you a clearer minds of surveillance technology .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Initially , surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) is implanted into the body of animals .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It functions to track the path of animals and help in scientific research .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides that , many animals which just be released from the protection of human for a long time are implanted the RFID as well to track their new life to ensure whether they could survive in the wild life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This technology are encouraged by some of the public that to implant the RFID into prisoners ' body .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The initial function is good indeed that to track the movement of them to protect the public safety and interest if they are out of prison .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view that object and resist implanting the RFID into prisoners ' body .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Their opinions are founded on the basic human rights .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Prisoners ' privacy is endangered due to the RFID .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After they release from the prison , the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They feel stressful under the control of government and it may lead to the ways that we do not desire and imagine .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore , some of parents hold the positive views to surveillance technology and agree to implant the RFID into their children 's body .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Their opinion is based on the children safety protection and parents ' guardian .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Children can be easily found if they are lost or abducted by other people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , there are both sides of stories .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This technology leads to a problem which is same with the prisoner issue that is the human privacy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Children are given birth by their parents ; parents are responsible to take good care of them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although the initial function of implementation of RFID is good for the children , however children also have the human rights and privacy which is endanger under this technology .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides tags into human body , there is also the issue of implant into products .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Recently , many of cell phone are equipped with GPS which means that they can find the device 's location if it is lost .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is also the advance of surveillance technology .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Children can easily be track based on the location of cell phone by parents .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Compared to the human implant , tags on the products is better and more suitable .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Under the products tags , children are given a significant free space as compared to the congested control by human implant .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Parents also can ensure the safety of children as well as do not endanger their privacy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is the ways that can " using one stone to kill two birds " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , based on the advantages and disadvantages discussed , I agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , to a certain extent , I agree to implant RFID tags on products to protect the safety of children .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As world pace becomes faster and faster , the need for maximum efficiency becomes stronger and stronger in every field .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To know where a certain item locates becomes one of the ways to improve efficiency .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , UPS can track the process of each delivery .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With the information about the location of the cargo , it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the company .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S RFID is one of the advanced technology for tracking .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Due to the small size of the equipment and the energy-saving feature , it becomes more and more popular in industries and logistics .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like watch or clothes , it did provide convenience in a certain situation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The biggest difference between human and animals or any other objects is that we have self-esteem or we need the basic respect from our peer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the basic rights of human is the right for privacy .

S In any period of time , as long as we do not offense others , we should enjoy the right of privacy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , the idea of using RFID to track people violates our need for privacy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Since RFID tags attached to the product can remain functional for a long period of time , it could be misused for surveillance purposed which are not related to the industries production or supply activities .
A 23 24|||R:MORPH|||purposes|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , a consumer buys a product with RFID from a supermarket .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As the RFID is embedded within the product , people who have the access to the information definitely can track him .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag , so this action could reveal the sensitive information of the consumers like home address , working address to someone who is not authorized to get the information .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If this piece of information is misused , chances are high that the consumer would suffer loss like financial loss or even cause danger to the life of the consumer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , if the product is what one needs to use every day like clothes or shoes , then the location of one will be revealed every seconds .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is just like there is an invisible stalker behind you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is not only scary but also illegal .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although someone would say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose , it is still not appropriate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We can think about this scenario : the location of us going on daily life will be sent to a computer to be processed and stored every second .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Does this sound reasonable to you ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As what we have mentioned above , as human being , we should enjoy our privacy during our life as long as we do not cause harm to others .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , RFID will violate our right of privacy during our shopping activities .

S There is no a doubt , tracking system has brought many benefits in this information age .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , tracking people are difficult and different from goods .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , a company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in Singapore , and is currently keeping tracking of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card system-a system which can be open to abuses such as an employee punching the card for another .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Goods are dead , but humans are alive .

S So , when employees begin to conflict with this tracking system , they will find some ways to escape the tracking system like asking friends to help them to punch the cards .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Finally , the company tracking system has no meaning at all , therefore tracking system is very terrible measure to control people .

S In addition , tracking people system may be used by bad people in a wrong way .

S How to explain this problem , it means that people are not sure who are in charge of these tracking system .

S For example , people go somewhere , no matter taking bus , MRT or driving , they are under the CCTVs .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If some bad people want to track someone for their personal purposes , by hacker technology , they can use government tracking system to do their own business .

S In other words , government originally hopes to use tracking system to ensure citizens safety , now it has been divulged human information .

S It is very dangerous for society , because people do not know who are tracking them , it must bring citizens trepidation .

S In conclusion , what I have mentioned above , we have to agree , tracking system has many benefits in different parts in humans life especially in this modern world .

S But tracking people is very terrible choice , it sounds like people invented a 'prison ' to jail themselves , people need homage and freedom .

S Although in many respects , this technology can be used in positive and evidently beneficial ways , in some area it is so controversial .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S By using this card , our identities can be confirmed and the information in a certain institution can be kept .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Otherwise , it is just a waste of resources .

S From the reasons above , we can see that the surveillance technology takes great danger with it so that we can not apply it to our daily life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , we can take the essence and reject its dross .

S In my point of view , surveillance technology should still be used to track people at present since there are no better solutions .

S Although that method may invade certain people 's right and privacy , but in exchange for that we can get a safe and peaceful society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If the surveillance technology is abandoned , it makes the police very difficult to track the suspicious people and can have little control of those people who are dangerous to the society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , without surveillance technology , the murders can escape much more easily since no one knows their position .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Without surveillance technology , the suspicious people might actually commit a murder and the murder can be much more serious if the police can not arrive in time to help out .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the murders and they might not commit more murder since they might be afraid of being tracked by the police .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If that technology is abandoned , it may trigger more bad people to commit murder or stole things since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not being punished by the law .

S Only police should be allowed to use surveillance technology and such technology can only be used to help tracking the murders or people suspected .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this paper , the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved by the discussion of violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authority .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First , the violation of privacy will be dramatically increased .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Typically , the RFID tags are small devices with a read-only chip .

S Second , when technology like RFID is widely used , there will be a trend to misuse such technology .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S An important feature of RFID is the minimal security .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Since it is read-only , the card can not protect itself .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , almost every one can gain access to the card reader as the reader requires only simple technology .

S Then , if a business man wants to defeat his competitor , he can just buy a reader and spy for commercial secrets .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hence , once RFID is widely used , people are very likely to spy on each other , which will destroy trust , respect and many moral values .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Third , to use the surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of the authority .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The government is supposed to serve the people .

S When government is able to find out all the precise information about its citizens , it can gradually apply control over them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Consequently , the government is very likely to turn to be a totalitarian authority , which will be the worst scenery and tragedy for every single citizen .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All in all , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track general population for the violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authority .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some people may argue that using RFID to track people will leave out individuals ' privacy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nevertheless , the activities I mentioned above are related little to privacy issues .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So , in the following , I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For the first part , rising life expectancies is a challenge .
A 7 8|||R:NOUN:NUM|||expectancy|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We should image that when the life expectancies are raised up ; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher .

S For these older people , the society need man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them .

S However , these older people usually contribute less or nearly have no productivity for the society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We have to say that the older people are becoming a black hole for the entire society in terms of man power and resources .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Not only has the family member of the old people , but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such situation .

S On the other hand , there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people 's daily life .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Due to all these reasons , people died quite early , which results in a low life expectancy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So , the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people is living .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In that sense , rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement .
A 6 7|||R:NOUN:NUM|||expectancy|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Population ageing : A more and more attention-getting topic
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nowadays , population aging has become a more global phenomenon .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Subsequently , a lot of problems regarding to it are arising .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Due the rise of the life span and the shrink of the birth rate , the portion of the elderly portion is larger and larger .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As our society develops , the people have a much higher living standard , which will reduce the chance of getting disease .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides , as the development of the technology , the medical therapy also has a tremendous progress .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many diseases which are incurable in the past can be cured now .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of died people annually .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , the birth rate in many countries keeps decreasing , whose figure is the lowest record comparing to previous figure .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Maybe , it is because the modern society is become more and more competitive , the parents are paying much attention and importance to their career .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They do not want to bother to spend so much time in raising and nurturing children .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Maybe that 's one reason for the reducing of the birth rate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The fact is that the current average life span is over 65 and the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This survey evidently shows that big achievement has been made in the medical area and people 's living standard has been improved .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It also indicates that the economy has been dramatically grown .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First , if the older people increase , there will be fewer workforces that can support the society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The most important part is health care and old-age pension .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As elderly people , they need more money for health care than the younger .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Government should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , for the older people , more facilities and service for them should be provided .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So more manpower will be employed , which deduces the labour in other area .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course , more money will be spent .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To pay this extra money , government will exert higher taxed on the other people .
A 10 11|||R:MORPH|||taxes|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thirdly , compared to the young people , the security of the elderly is more notable .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Elderly people 's ability to move and act is much lower .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , some measurement and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To conclude , the population ageing phenomenon indeed shows our big achievement on economy , medical skills and living standard .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nonetheless , the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S More elderly people will bring a big extra burden to the society and government .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S More facilities and service will be needed to fulfill these requirements .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Definitely , we should perform these demanded duties very responsibly and carefully .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Whereas , for the sustainable development of the country and the earth , some measurements and policies should be carried out to control and change this phenomenon .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it is an evidence of progress of modern medical technology and meanwhile it is a challenge because it can incur the problem of lacking work force or too large population .

S For ancient people it is miraculous to achieve 70 years old , but now it is general .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Rising life expectancies can bring us more skilled work force because we can delay the retirement time to extend working time for each person .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Longer working period means the old person who is more skilled does not need to retire and no fresh men will take over .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thus it is more efficient to keep more skilled people for long time rather than training fresh men .

S On the other hand , if there are enough young people , then young people with rising life expectancies will cause larger population .

S If there are less young people and more old people , as in both Singapore and China , when elderly retire , there are not enough young people who can make up for the new available positions .

S If there are more young people , then there will be even more elderly with rising life expectancies in the future definitely .

S Population is large while the resources are limited , which will incur many problems such as environmental problems and inequality among people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Expansion of population can not continue like that because the resources are limited , and we will end with dying out after using up all resources .

S If the above two aspects are described as the hardwares of the system , they do require a software to function , which is the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens .

S When people become old , most of them join the weak group of citizens who have to live by receiving care from other people .

S To take care of old people , facillities such as nursing homes should be built , which add on to the expense of society .
